England/NNP captain/NN Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP has/VBZ rubbished/VBN suggestions/NNS that/IN the/DT world/NN champions/NNS are/VBP a/DT team/NN in/IN decline./NN

England/NNP were/VBD beaten/VBN 11-9/JJ by/IN Wales/NNP in/IN their/PRP$ Six/CD Nations/NNPS opener/NN in/IN Cardiff/NNP last/JJ week/NN and/CC face/NN current/JJ champions/NNS France/NNP at/IN Twickenham/NNP on/IN Sunday./NNP
Robinson/NNP said/VBD "We/NN are/VBP certainly/RB not/RB on/IN the/DT decline./NN
You/PRP lose/VBP one/CD game/NN and/CC it/PRP doesn't/NN make/VBP you/PRP a/DT bad/JJ team./NN
"I/NN have/VBP no/DT doubt/NN in/IN the/DT players/NNS we've/NN got./NN
We/PRP have/VBP still/RB got/VBN the/DT team/NN to/TO go/VB out/RB and/CC beat/VB anyone/NN on/IN our/PRP$ day."/NN England/NNP find/VB themselves/PRP striving/VBG to/TO avoid/VB a/DT third/JJ successive/JJ championship/NN defeat/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN since/IN 1987./CD
But/CC full-back/JJ Robinson/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT new-look/JJ England/NNP team/NN can/MD stop/VB the/DT rot/NN against/IN France./NNP

"Last/NN weekend/NN we/PRP should/MD have/VB won/VBN the/DT game"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"But/NN if/IN we/PRP can/MD under-perform/VB and/CC lose/VB by/IN only/RB two/CD points/NNS then/RB I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ if/IN we/PRP play/VBP well/RB this/DT week/NN we/PRP will/MD get/VB the/DT win/NN we/PRP need./VBP
"We/NN proved/VBD that/IN in/IN the/DT autumn/NN -/: when/WRB we/PRP put/VBD in/IN some/DT excellent/JJ performances/NNS -/: and/CC we/PRP just/RB need/VBP to/TO build/VB on/IN that./NN

"It/NN was/VBD a/DT disappointing/JJ start/NN against/IN Wales/NNP and/CC we/PRP might/MD be/VB down/RP on/IN that./NN
"But/NN we/PRP are/VBP certainly/RB not/RB out./NN
We/PRP will/MD come/VB out/RP fighting/VBG this/DT week."/NN Robinson/NNP also/RB had/VBD words/NNS of/IN comfort/NN for/IN 18-year-old/JJ Newcastle/NNP centre/NN Mathew/NNP Tait/NNP who/WP made/VBD his/PRP$ international/JJ debut/NN against/IN Wales/NNP but/CC has/VBZ been/VBN demoted/VBN from/IN the/DT squad/NN to/TO face/VB France./NNP

"I/NN have/VBP had/VBN a/DT word/NN with/IN Mathew"/NNP said/VBD Robinson./NNP
"I/NN still/RB believe/VBP in/IN him./NN
He/PRP is/VBZ an/DT outstanding/JJ player/NN but/CC we/PRP have/VBP gone/VBN for/IN Olly/NNP (Barkley)/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT kicking./NN
"Mathew/NN has/VBZ just/RB got/VBN to/TO take/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT chin/NN keep/NN working/VBG hard/RB like/IN he/PRP is/VBZ doing/VBG and/CC I'm/NNP sure/JJ he/PRP will/MD feature/VB in/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT games."/NN
