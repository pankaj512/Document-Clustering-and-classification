Could/MD rivalry/VB overshadow/NN election?/NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP and/CC Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP are/VBP desperately/RB trying/VBG to/TO stuff/VB the/DT genie/NN of/IN their/PRP$ rivalry/NN back/RB into/IN the/DT bottle./NN

Along/IN with/IN any/DT number/NN of/IN senior/JJ cabinet/NN colleagues/NNS they/PRP are/VBP insisting/VBG their/PRP$ only/JJ job/NN is/VBZ to/TO win/VB the/DT next/JJ election/NN and/CC govern/VB in/IN the/DT best/JJS interests/NNS of/IN Britain./NNP
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT message/NN they/PRP are/VBP aiming/VBG directly/RB at/IN their/PRP$ backbenchers/NNS who/WP are/VBP becoming/VBG irritated/JJ and/CC even/RB unnerved/JJ by/IN the/DT continuing/VBG claims/NNS and/CC counter/VB claims/NNS surrounding/VBG this/DT alleged/VBN rift./NN
Ian/NNP Gibson/NNP for/IN example/NN urged/VBD the/DT two/CD men/NNS to/TO stop/VB squabbling/NN declaring/VBG "For/NN goodness/NN sake/NN sometimes/RB you/PRP have/VBP to/TO rise/VB above/IN petulance/NN and/CC make/VB sure/JJ that/IN you/PRP do/VBP your/PRP$ job/NN as/RB effectively/RB as/IN you/PRP can."/VBP Those/DT with/IN slim/JJ majorities/NNS are/VBP particularly/RB fearful/JJ that/IN the/DT rift/NN could/MD hit/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ hopes/NNS of/IN re-election./JJ
Tony/NNP Blair/NNP will/MD seek/VB to/TO reassure/VB Labour/NNP MPs/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP evening/NN at/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ year/NN at/IN Westminster/NNP -/: a/DT behind-closed/JJ doors/NNS meeting/NN which/WDT Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP is/VBZ thought/VBN likely/JJ to/TO also/RB attend/VB to/TO show/VB unity./NN

Meanwhile/RB the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Health/NNP Secretary/NNP John/NNP Reid/NNP and/CC Labour/NNP peer/VBP Lord/NNP Haskins/NNP are/VBP warning/NN of/IN the/DT electoral/JJ dangers/NNS of/IN allowing/VBG this/DT soap/NN opera/NN to/TO continue./VB
And/CC they/PRP have/VBP both/DT warned/VBN the/DT rival/JJ camps/NNS to/TO stop/VB spreading/VBG the/DT poison./NN
Lord/NNP Haskins/NNP even/RB suggested/VBD Mr/NNP Blair/NNP should/MD reinstate/VB Mr/NNP Brown/NNP as/IN the/DT central/JJ figure/NN in/IN the/DT election/NN planning./NN

But/CC this/DT particular/JJ genie/NN is/VBZ unusually/RB reluctant/JJ to/TO return/VB to/TO captivity/NN and/CC many/JJ fear/NN it/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB too/RB late/JJ to/TO repair/VB the/DT damage./NN
They/PRP believe/VBP they/PRP will/MD be/VB fighting/VBG the/DT next/JJ election/NN with/IN the/DT sounds/NNS of/IN open/JJ warfare/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD men/NNS ringing/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ ears./NN
And/CC it/PRP matters/VBZ little/JJ whether/IN the/DT rift/NN is/VBZ real/JJ or/CC as/IN some/DT try/NN to/TO suggest/VB simply/RB the/DT product/NN of/IN newspaper/NN headlines/NNS and/CC Westminster/NNP gossip./NN
Few/JJ in/IN Westminster/NNP actually/RB believe/VBP that/IN simply/RB because/IN the/DT evidence/NN appears/VBZ to/TO contradict/VB it./NN

For/IN example/NN the/DT weekend's/NNS attempts/NNS by/IN both/DT men/NNS to/TO play/VB down/RP the/DT divisions/NNS failed/VBD to/TO do/VB the/DT trick./NN
Even/RB as/IN they/PRP were/VBD both/DT insisting/NN on/IN their/PRP$ unity/NN of/IN purpose/NN and/CC claiming/VBG they/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB swayed/VBN by/IN newspaper/NN stories/NNS they/PRP still/RB managed/VBD to/TO stir/VB the/DT speculation/NN with/IN their/PRP$ comments./NN

Mr/NNP Blair/NNP talked/VBD about/IN the/DT "New"/NN Labour/NNP manifesto/NN -/: a/DT move/NN which/WDT seemed/VBD calculated/VBN to/TO irritate/VB the/DT chancellor/NN who/WP has/VBZ long/RB rejected/VBN the/DT label./NN
And/CC Mr/NNP Brown/NNP pointedly/RB refused/VBD to/TO deny/VB claims/NNS the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN had/VBD reneged/VBN on/IN a/DT deal/NN to/TO hand/VB him/PRP the/DT premiership/NN last/JJ year./NN
That/DT claim/NN was/VBD repeated/VBN in/IN Robert/NNP Peston's/NNP book/NN a/DT book/NN which/WDT amply/RB demonstrates/VBZ this/DT corrosive/JJ Downing/NNP Street/NNP soap/NN opera/NN is/VBZ nowhere/RB near/IN its/PRP$ final/JJ act./NN

For/IN his/PRP$ part/NN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP insists/VBZ his/PRP$ only/JJ motivation/NN was/VBD to/TO get/VB Labour/NNP re-elected./JJ

The/DT trouble/NN is/VBZ both/DT men/NNS have/VBP fallen/VBN short/JJ of/IN offering/VBG simple/JJ straightforward/JJ denials/NNS of/IN the/DT central/JJ claims./NN
So/RB they/PRP have/VBP both/DT been/VBN accused/VBN of/IN actually/RB making/VBG matters/NNS worse/RBR by/IN feeding/VBG the/DT speculation/NN with/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ behaviour./NN
The/DT first/JJ thing/NN to/TO be/VB said/VBN is/VBZ that/IN these/DT suggestions/NNS have/VBP not/RB come/VB from/IN nowhere./NN
They/PRP started/VBD with/IN and/CC are/VBP sustained/VBN by/IN "friends"/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD men./NN
One/CD only/RB had/VBD to/TO listen/VB to/TO the/DT chancellor's/NNS friend/NN and/CC former/JJ spin/VBP chief/JJ Charlie/NNP Whelan/NNP last/JJ week/NN to/TO understand/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ anger/NN from/IN this/DT camp/NN at/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister's/NNS apparent/JJ attempts/NNS to/TO confound/VB Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP leadership/NN ambitions./NN
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB just/RB public/JJ pronouncements/NNS from/IN ex-aides./NN

There/EX are/VBP whispered/VBN briefings/NNS to/TO selected/JJ journalists/NNS from/IN both/DT sides./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ no/DT secret/NN in/IN Westminster/NNP for/IN example/NN that/IN Downing/NNP Street/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT chancellor/NN is/VBZ indulging/VBG in/IN a/DT mammoth/JJ sulk/NN and/CC acting/VBG in/IN a/DT petty/NN and/CC deliberately/RB provocative/JJ manner./NN

Then/RB there/EX are/VBP the/DT actions/NNS of/IN the/DT men/NNS themselves./NN
Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP sets/VBZ out/RP what/WP is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN a/DT rival/JJ manifesto/NN then/RB appears/VBZ to/TO embark/VB on/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ personal/JJ campaign./NN
The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN responds/VBZ by/IN scheduling/NN his/PRP$ monthly/JJ press/NN conference/NN to/TO clash/VB with/IN a/DT keynote/NN speech/NN by/IN the/DT chancellor./NN
Meanwhile/RB large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN backbench/JJ MPs/NNP insist/VBP voters/NNS are/VBP either/CC entirely/RB uninterested/JJ in/IN the/DT chatter/NN which/WDT they/PRP believe/VBP is/VBZ a/DT media-only/JJ obsession/NN or/CC that/IN they/PRP fear/VBP for/IN the/DT efficient/JJ running/NN of/IN a/DT government/NN beset/VBD by/IN such/JJ rivalry./NN
Either/CC way/NN there/EX is/VBZ universal/JJ agreement/NN that/IN if/IN this/DT goes/VBZ on/IN through/IN the/DT general/JJ election/NN it/PRP can/MD only/RB do/VB the/DT Labour/NNP party/NN serious/JJ damage./NN
There/EX are/VBP signs/NNS that/IN the/DT two/CD men/NNS appreciate/VBP the/DT dangers/NNS and/CC both/DT want/VBP to/TO put/VB a/DT lid/NN on/IN all/PDT the/DT speculation./NN
But/CC with/IN probably/RB only/RB four/CD months/NNS to/TO the/DT next/JJ election/NN that/WDT looks/VBZ like/IN being/VBG a/DT particularly/RB difficult/JJ trick/NN to/TO pull/VB off./NN
