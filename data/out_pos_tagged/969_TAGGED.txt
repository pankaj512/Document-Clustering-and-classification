The/DT legislation/NN would/MD have/VB ended/VBN the/DT right/NN of/IN male/JJ heirs/NNS with/IN older/JJR sisters/NNS to/TO succeed/VB to/TO the/DT Crown./NNP
It/PRP would/MD also/RB have/VB torn/VBN up/RP ancient/JJ legislation/NN banning/VBG heirs/NNS to/TO the/DT throne/NN marrying/VBG Roman/NNP Catholics./NNP
But/CC the/DT government/NN refused/VBD to/TO back/VB Lord/NNP Dubs'/NNP Succession/NN to/TO the/DT Crown/NNP Bill/NNP saying/VBG it/PRP was/VBD too/RB complex/JJ and/CC raised/VBD too/RB many/JJ constitutional/JJ issues./NN

The/DT Lord/NNP Chancellor/NNP Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP agreed/VBD the/DT 1701/CD Act/NNP of/IN Settlement/NNP which/WDT governs/NNS the/DT succession/NN was/VBD discriminatory/JJ but/CC added/VBD that/DT "for/NN all/DT practical/JJ purposes/VBZ its/PRP$ effects/NNS are/VBP limited"./NN

The/DT changes/NNS proposed/VBD by/IN Lord/NNP Dubs/VBZ were/VBD a/DT "complex/NN and/CC controversial/JJ undertaking/NN raising/VBG major/JJ constitutional/JJ issues"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP said/VBD there/EX were/VBD 22/CD members/NNS of/IN the/DT Royal/NNP Family/NNP in/IN the/DT line/NN of/IN succession/NN after/IN the/DT Prince/NNP of/IN Wales/NNP -/: all/DT of/IN who/WP were/VBD eligible/JJ to/TO succeed/VB and/CC had/VBD been/VBN unaffected/JJ by/IN the/DT act./NN

While/IN we/PRP wish/VBP to/TO remove/VB all/DT forms/NNS of/IN discrimination.../JJ
this/DT isn't/NN the/DT proper/JJ form"/NN he/PRP added./VB

He/PRP did/VBD not/RB rule/VB out/RP change/NN in/IN the/DT future/JJ but/CC said/VBD if/IN Lord/NNP Dubs'/NNP private/JJ member's/NNS bill/NN was/VBD passed/VBN by/IN peers/NNS he/PRP would/MD urge/VB MPs/NNP to/TO oppose/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT Commons./NNP

"We/NN cannot/NN forever/RB say/VBP we/PRP don't/VBP want/VBP to/TO change/VB things/NNS because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB difficult"/NN he/PRP told/VBD peers./NN
During/IN the/DT debate/NN the/DT Labour/NNP peer/NN and/CC former/JJ minister/NN said/VBD "The/NN monarchy/NN should/MD symbolise/VB the/DT values/NNS of/IN this/DT country./NN
"What/NN we/PRP don't/VBP want/VBP is/VBZ a/DT situation/NN where/WRB the/DT values/NNS of/IN the/DT country/NN have/VBP moved/VBN on/IN and/CC the/DT monarchy/NN is/VBZ centuries/NNS behind/IN the/DT times./NN
"We/NN are/VBP surely/RB all/DT opposed/VBN to/TO discrimination/VB on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN gender/NN and/CC we/PRP are/VBP surely/RB also/RB opposed/VBN to/TO discrimination/VB against/IN Catholics."/NNP But/CC opponents/NNS of/IN the/DT bill/NN including/VBG Tory/NNP Lord/NNP Campbell/NNP of/IN Alloway/NNP and/CC the/DT Bishop/NNP of/IN Winchester/NNP the/DT Rt/NNP Rev/NNP Michael/NNP Scott-Joynt/NNP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD separate/VB the/DT state/NN from/IN both/DT the/DT Church/NNP of/IN England/NNP and/CC the/DT Christian/NNP faith./NN
