US/PRP trade/VBP gap/NN hits/NNS record/NN in/IN 2004/CD

The/DT gap/NN between/IN US/PRP exports/VBZ and/CC imports/NNS hit/VBD an/DT all-time/JJ high/NN of/IN $671.7bn/CD (£484bn)/CD in/IN 2004/CD latest/JJS figures/NNS show./NN

The/DT Commerce/NNP Department/NNP said/VBD the/DT trade/NN deficit/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN last/JJ year/NN was/VBD 24.4%/CD above/IN the/DT previous/JJ record/NN -/: 2003's/CD imbalance/NN of/IN $496.5bn./CD
The/DT deficit/NN with/IN China/NNP up/RP 30.5%/CD at/IN $162bn/CD was/VBD the/DT largest/JJS ever/RB recorded/VBN with/IN a/DT single/JJ country./NN
However/RB on/IN a/DT monthly/JJ basis/NN the/DT US/PRP trade/VBP gap/NN narrowed/VBN by/IN 4.9%/CD in/IN December/NNP to/TO £56.4bn./CD
The/DT US/PRP consumer's/VBZ appetite/NN for/IN all/DT things/NNS from/IN oil/NN to/TO imported/VBN cars/NNS and/CC even/RB wine/NN and/CC cheese/NN reached/VBD record/NN levels/NNS last/JJ year/NN and/CC the/DT figures/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO spark/VB fresh/JJ criticism/NN of/IN President/NNP Bush's/NNP economic/JJ policies./NN

Democrats/NNPS claim/VBP the/DT administration/NN has/VBZ not/RB done/VBN enough/RB to/TO clamp/VB down/RP on/IN unfair/JJ foreign/JJ trade/NN practices./NN
For/IN example/NN they/PRP believe/VBP China's/NNP currency/NN policy/NN -/: which/WDT US/PRP manufacturers/VBZ claim/VBP has/VBZ undervalued/VBN the/DT yuan/NN by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN 40%/CD -/: has/VBZ given/VBN China's/NNP rapidly/RB expanding/VBG economy/NN an/DT unfair/JJ advantage/NN against/IN US/PRP competitors./VBP

Meanwhile/RB the/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN argues/VBZ that/IN the/DT US/PRP deficit/VBP reflects/VBZ the/DT fact/NN the/DT America/NNP is/VBZ growing/VBG at/IN faster/JJR rate/NN than/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN spurring/VBG on/IN more/JJR demand/NN for/IN imported/VBN goods./NN
Some/DT economists/NNS say/VBP this/DT may/MD allow/VB an/DT upward/JJ revision/NN of/IN US/PRP economic/JJ growth/NN in/IN the/DT fourth/JJ quarter./NN
But/CC others/NNS point/VBP out/RP that/IN the/DT deficit/NN has/VBZ reached/VBN such/JJ astronomical/JJ proportions/NNS that/WDT foreigners/NNS many/JJ choose/VBP not/RB to/TO hold/VB as/IN many/JJ dollar-denominated/JJ assets/NNS which/WDT may/MD in/IN turn/NN harm/NN growth./NN
For/IN all/DT of/IN 2004/CD US/PRP exports/VBZ rose/VBD 12.3%/CD to/TO $1.15/CD trillion/CD but/CC imports/NNS rose/VBD even/RB faster/RBR by/IN 16.3%/CD to/TO a/DT new/JJ record/NN of/IN $1.76/CD trillion./NN
Foreign/JJ oil/NN exports/NNS surged/VBN by/IN 35.7%/CD to/TO a/DT record/NN $180.7bn/CD reflecting/VBG the/DT rally/NN in/IN global/JJ oil/NN prices/NNS and/CC increasing/VBG domestic/JJ demand./NN
Imports/NNS were/VBD not/RB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT dollar's/NNS weakness/VBP last/JJ year./NN
"We/NN expect/VBP the/DT deficit/NN to/TO continue/VB to/TO widen/VB in/IN 2005/CD even/RB if/IN the/DT dollar/NN gets/VBZ back/RB to/TO its/PRP$ downward/JJ trend"/NN said/VBD economist/NN Marie-Pierre/NNP Ripert/NNP at/IN IXIS./NNP
