"I/NN don't/NN want/VBP referees/NNS or/CC myself/PRP getting/VBG in/IN the/DT psychological/JJ warfare/NN between/IN two/CD managers./NN
For/IN the/DT second/JJ leg/NN we/PRP have/VBP an/DT experienced/VBN referee/NN and/CC we/PRP should/MD be/VB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN that/DT game/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT refereeing./NN
