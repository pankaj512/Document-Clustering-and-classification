Mr/NNP Brown/NNP told/VBD the/DT House/NNP that/DT government/NN policy/NN is/VBZ to/TO raise/VB fuel/NN duty/NN at/IN least/JJS in/IN line/NN with/IN inflation/NN each/DT year/NN to/TO fulfil/VB environmental/JJ commitments./NN
But/CC this/DT financial/JJ year/NN because/IN of/IN "volatility/NN in/IN the/DT oil/NN market"/NN he/PRP said/VBD the/DT duty/NN would/MD be/VB frozen./NN
During/IN 2000/CD many/JJ motorists/NNS campaigned/VBN against/IN the/DT rises/NNS but/CC environmentalists/NNS believe/VBP less/JJR duty/NN means/VBZ more/JJR pollution./NN
He/PRP said/VBD "It/NN is/VBZ our/PRP$ policy/NN that/IN each/DT year/NN fuel/NN duties/NNS should/MD rise/VB at/IN least/JJS in/IN line/NN with/IN inflation/NN as/IN we/PRP seek/VBP to/TO meet/VB our/PRP$ targets/NNS for/IN reducing/VBG polluting/VBG emmissions/NNS and/CC fund/VB our/PRP$ public/JJ services./NN

Environmental/NNP group/NN Transport/NNP 2000/CD said/VBD the/DT freeze/NN sends/VBZ the/DT wrong/JJ message/NN to/TO motorists./VB
"We/NN are/VBP concerned/VBN that/IN although/IN Britain/NNP leads/VBZ the/DT world/NN in/IN rhetoric/NN about/IN climate/NN change/NN it/PRP often/RB fails/VBZ in/IN practical/JJ action"/NN said/VBD a/DT spokesman./NN
