The/DT game/NN appealed/VBD to/TO the/DT Kiwi/NN psyche/NN and/CC quickly/RB spread/VB the/DT native/JJ Maoris/NNP finding/VBG a/DT particular/JJ empathy/NN with/IN the/DT sport's/NNS warrior/NN ethos./NN
In/IN 1888/CD a/DT British/JJ team/NN led/VBN by/IN AE/NNP Stoddart/NNP toured/VBD New/NNP Zealand/NNP and/CC Australia/NNP and/CC soon/RB after/IN a/DT Maori/NNP named/VBD Joe/NNP Warbrick/NNP and/CC an/DT English/JJ ex-pat/NN called/VBN Thomas/NNP Eyton/NNP decided/VBD to/TO gather/VB a/DT combined/VBN New/NNP Zealand/NNP team./NN

The/DT integration/NN of/IN white/JJ and/CC Maori/NNP was/VBD a/DT reflecion/NN of/IN enlightened/VBN New/NNP Zealand/NNP rugby/NN and/CC society/NN even/RB if/IN the/DT British/JJ press/NN were/VBD somewhat/RB mystified/VBN by/IN the/DT pre-match/JJ tradition/NN of/IN the/DT Maori/NNP war/NN dance/NN the/DT Haka/NNP The/DT other/JJ great/JJ symbol/NN of/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP rugby/NN the/DT all/DT black/JJ kit/NN with/IN the/DT silver/NN fern/NN on/IN the/DT breast/NN was/VBD proposed/VBN by/IN Tom/NNP Ellison/NNP at/IN the/DT first/JJ annual/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP Zealand/NNP Rugby/NNP Football/NNP Union/NNP in/IN 1893./CD

The/DT tourists/NNS had/VBD gone/VBN through/IN Australia/NNP undefeated/JJ but/CC their/PRP$ captain/NN David/NNP Revell/NNP Bedell-Sivright/NNP created/VBD animosity/NN in/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP with/IN his/PRP$ patronising/VBG attitude./NN
The/DT Kiwis/NNP shocked/VBD the/DT rugby/NN world/NN with/IN a/DT 9-3/JJ triumph/NN in/IN Wellington/NNP sparking/VBG great/JJ celebrations/NNS across/IN the/DT country/NN but/CC Bedell-Sivright/NNP churlishly/RB suggested/VBD that/IN the/DT victors/NNS would/MD have/VB no/DT chance/NN when/WRB they/PRP visited/VBD the/DT UK./NNP

Their/PRP$ opportunity/NN to/TO prove/VB him/PRP wrong/RB came/VBD in/IN 1905/CD with/IN the/DT first/JJ official/NN New/NNP Zealand/NNP tour/NN to/TO Europe./NNP
The/DT tourists/NNS won/VBD their/PRP$ early/JJ games/NNS with/IN a/DT quick-thinking/JJ inventive/JJ approach/NN but/CC press/NN criticism/NN began/VBD to/TO grow/VB over/IN their/PRP$ 2-3-2/JJ scrum/NN formation/NN that/WDT left/VBD a/DT 'roving'/NN forward/RB free/JJ to/TO disrupt/VB opposition/NN attacks./NN
The/DT tactic/NN was/VBD effective/JJ two/CD late/JJ tries/VBZ seeing/VBG the/DT Kiwis/NNP to/TO a/DT 12-7/JJ win/NN over/IN Scotland/NNP before/IN Ireland/NNP were/VBD despatched/VBN 15-0/JJ in/IN Dublin./NNP

The/DT awesome/JJ 1924-5/JJ All/DT Black/NNP tourists/NNS became/VBD known/VBN as/IN 'The/NN Invincibles'/NNP after/IN winning/VBG all/DT 30/CD of/IN their/PRP$ games/NNS in/IN France/NNP Britain/NNP and/CC Ireland/NNP including/VBG a/DT crushing/VBG 19-0/JJ victory/NN over/IN Wales/NNP at/IN St/NNP Helen's./NNP
Despite/IN their/PRP$ success/NN the/DT All/DT Blacks'/NNP 2-3-2/JJ scrum/NN formation/NN left/VBD them/PRP somewhat/RB short/JJ of/IN possession/NN at/IN times/NNS and/CC the/DT flaws/NNS were/VBD exploited/VBN by/IN the/DT Springboks/NNP in/IN South/NNP Africa/NNP in/IN 1928./CD
Employing/VBG the/DT modern/JJ 3-4-1/JJ scrum/NN line-up/JJ against/IN the/DT New/NNP Zealand/NNP 'rover'/NN system/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN South/JJ African/JJ teams/NNS defeated/VBD the/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS in/IN five/CD games/NNS and/CC the/DT Test/NNP series/NN was/VBD drawn/VBN two-all./JJ
The/DT controversial/JJ New/NNP Zealand/NNP scrum/NN method/NN finally/RB disappeared/VBD after/IN the/DT 1930/CD Lions/NNP tour/NN (a/NN series/NN won/VBD 3-1/JJ by/IN New/NNP Zealand)/NNP the/DT Lions/NNP manager/NN describing/VBG the/DT tactic/NN as/IN 'cheating'/NN prompting/VBG the/DT International/NNP Rugby/NNP Board/NNP to/TO rule/VB that/IN three/CD men/NNS had/VBD to/TO pack/VB down/RP in/IN the/DT front/JJ row/NN of/IN the/DT scrum./NN

The/DT All/DT Blacks'/NNP 1935/CD European/JJ tour/NN started/VBD inauspiciously/RB with/IN an/DT 11-3/JJ loss/NN to/TO a/DT Swansea/NNP side/NN inspired/VBN by/IN teenage/JJ schoolboy/NN half-backs/NNS Hayden/NNP Tanner/NNP and/CC Willie/NNP Davies./NNP
A/DT thrilling/VBG Test/NNP at/IN Cardiff/NNP Arms/NNS Park/NNP went/VBD to/TO Wales/NNP 13-12/JJ although/IN the/DT winning/VBG try/NN from/IN Geoffrey/NNP Rees-Jones/NNP was/VBD controversial/JJ following/NN an/DT illegal/JJ Claude/NNP Davey/NNP tackle/VB in/IN the/DT build-up./JJ
New/NNP Zealand's/NNP next/JJ visit/NN to/TO Wales/NNP in/IN 1953/CD proved/VBD difficult/JJ as/IN they/PRP lost/VBD 8-3/JJ to/TO Cardiff/NNP and/CC drew/VBD 6-6/JJ at/IN Swansea./NNP
The/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS were/VBD on/IN top/NN in/IN the/DT Test/NNP with/IN Wales/NNP at/IN the/DT Arms/NNS Park/NNP but/CC the/DT teams/NNS were/VBD locked/VBN at/IN 8-8/JJ when/WRB a/DT Clem/NNP Thomas/NNP cross/VB kick/VBP was/VBD gathered/VBN by/IN Ken/NNP Jones/NNP for/IN a/DT famous/JJ match-winning/JJ try./NN
The/DT tourists/NNS made/VBD some/DT amends/NNS with/IN wins/VBZ over/IN the/DT other/JJ home/NN nations/NNS before/IN a/DT 19-5/JJ success/NN over/IN the/DT Barbarians/NNPS in/IN an/DT Arms/NNS Park/NNP thriller./NN
New/NNP Zealand/NNP built/VBD from/IN that/DT tour/NN and/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN they/PRP returned/VBD in/IN 1963-4/JJ they/PRP were/VBD undoubtedly/RB the/DT leading/VBG side/NN in/IN the/DT world./NN

That/WDT made/VBD the/DT shock/NN all/PDT the/DT greater/JJR when/WRB a/DT drop/NN goal/NN by/IN student/NN John/NNP Uzzell/NNP gave/VBD Newport/NNP an/DT unlikely/JJ 3-0/JJ win/NN over/IN the/DT tourists/NNS at/IN Rodney/NNP Parade./NNP

A/DT ferocious/JJ game/NN at/IN the/DT Arms/NNS Park/NNP in/IN 1972/CD was/VBD edged/VBN 19-16/JJ by/IN the/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS a/DT measure/NN of/IN revenge/NN for/IN the/DT defeat/NN inflicted/VBN on/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP by/IN the/DT Carwyn/NNP James-inspired/NNP Lions/NNP of/IN 1971./CD

Wales/NNP were/VBD leading/VBG 12-10/JJ with/IN one/CD minute/NN left/VBN when/WRB Andy/NNP Haden/NNP flew/VBD to/TO the/DT floor/NN from/IN a/DT line-out./JJ

Since/IN that/DT infamous/JJ game/NN the/DT competition/NN has/VBZ largely/RB left/VBN Wales/NNP v/NN New/NNP Zealand/NNP fixtures/NNS as/IN the/DT men/NNS in/IN red/JJ have/VBP slipped/VBN from/IN the/DT pinnacle/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN game./NN

The/DT new/JJ professionalism/NN in/IN the/DT southern/JJ hemisphere/NN game/NN that/WDT had/VBD left/VBN Europe/NNP behind/IN was/VBD shown/VBN as/IN the/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS swatted/VBD Wales/NNP aside/RB 49-6/JJ in/IN Brisbane/NNP in/IN the/DT semi-final/NN of/IN the/DT inaugural/JJ World/NNP Cup./NNP

A/DT young/NN talented/VBN Wales/NNP side/NN left/VBN Britain/NNP full/JJ of/IN confidence/NN as/IN Triple/JJ Crown/NNP winners/NNS but/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS ever/RB New/NNP Zealand/NNP teams/NNS demolished/VBD them/PRP 52-3/JJ and/CC 54-9./JJ

A/DT bruising/VBG 55-3/JJ defeat/NN followed/VBD for/IN Wales/NNP in/IN Hamilton/NNP in/IN 2003/CD as/IN Hansen/NNP built/VBD towards/IN the/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP but/CC in/IN Australia/NNP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT remarkable/JJ performance/NN against/IN the/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS that/WDT gave/VBD his/PRP$ side/NN renewed/VBD hope./NN
Wales/NNP were/VBD given/VBN no/DT chance/NN going/VBG into/IN the/DT game/NN but/CC in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT match/NN they/PRP rediscovered/VBD the/DT value/NN of/IN attacking/VBG flair/NN to/TO lead/VB 37-33/JJ early/NN in/IN the/DT second/JJ half./NN
New/NNP Zealand/NNP rallied/VBD to/TO a/DT 53-37/JJ win/NN but/CC the/DT style/NN shown/VBN by/IN Wales/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN used/VBN as/IN an/DT inspiration/NN as/IN they/PRP look/VBP to/TO a/DT better/JJR future./NN
