The/DT memory/NN driving/VBG Brown's/NNP mission/NN

The/DT memory/NN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP says/VBZ keeps/VBZ returning/VBG to/TO him/PRP -/: the/DT one/NN that/IN he/PRP says/VBZ is/VBZ burnt/VBN into/IN him/PRP -/: is/VBZ that/IN of/IN a/DT 12/CD year-old/JJ girl/NN whose/WP$ parents/NNS died/VBD of/IN Aids/NNS and/CC who/WP is/VBZ HIV/NNP positive/JJ herself./NN

Mr/NNP Brown/NNP seems/VBZ haunted/VBN by/IN her/PRP$ eyes/NNS desolate/JJ of/IN all/DT hope./NN
And/CC then/RB he/PRP talks/VBZ of/IN those/DT eyes/NNS that/WDT do/VBP inspire/VB optimism/NN an/DT extraordinary/JJ performance/NN by/IN schoolgirls/NNS of/IN Kenya's/NNP largest/JJS slum/NN advancing/VBG with/IN crowded/JJ menace/NN flicking/VBG their/PRP$ hips/NNS in/IN a/DT manner/NN almost/RB as/IN disturbing/JJ before/IN the/DT finale/NN of/IN a/DT clenched/JJ fist/NN salute/NN and/CC shout/VBP of/IN "free/NN education/NN -/: free/JJ education/NN for/IN all"./NN
Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP message/NN generally/RB that/DT compassion/NN must/MD become/VB action/NN before/IN that/DT hope/NN is/VBZ squandered./NN
But/CC he/PRP is/VBZ such/PDT a/DT pivotal/JJ figure/NN in/IN British/JJ politics/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ almost/RB impossible/JJ not/RB to/TO ask/VB him/PRP why/WRB he/PRP is/VBZ doing/VBG this./NN
His/PRP$ answer/NN in/IN part/NN is/VBZ because/IN of/IN the/DT missionaries/NNS that/WDT used/VBD to/TO come/VB to/TO his/PRP$ father's/NNS church./NN
Ever/RB since/IN he/PRP says/VBZ Africa/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN important/JJ to/TO him./VB

I've/NNP absolutely/RB no/DT doubt/NN whatsoever/RB this/DT is/VBZ heartfelt./NN
But/CC he/PRP also/RB believes/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN for/IN the/DT world/NN to/TO see/VB a/DT new/JJ Gordon/NNP Brown./NNP
Not/RB the/DT dull/JJ reassuring/JJ bank/NN manager/NN but/CC a/DT man/NN driven/VBN by/IN a/DT moral/JJ passion/NN -/: and/CC it/PRP just/RB so/RB happens/VBZ the/DT Labour/NNP Party/NNP feels/VBZ an/DT awful/JJ lot/NN happier/JJR ridding/VBG the/DT world/NN of/IN debt/NN than/IN ridding/VBG the/DT world/NN of/IN dictators./NN

There's/NNP also/RB a/DT sense/NN of/IN liberation./NN
If/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP won't/NN allow/NN him/PRP to/TO run/VB the/DT election/NN campaign/NN then/RB he/PRP can/MD at/IN least/JJS pretend/VB it/PRP was/VBD all/DT getting/VBG tedious/JJ and/CC he'd/NN much/RB rather/RB be/VB out/RP examining/VBG social/JJ problems/NNS in/IN the/DT raw./NN
It/PRP also/RB goes/VBZ some/DT way/NN to/TO solving/VBG one/CD of/IN the/DT overarching/JJ problems/NNS for/IN all/DT politicians/NNS of/IN all/DT parties/NNS scepticism/NN sliding/VBG into/IN cynicism/NN about/IN politics/NNS itself./NN
If/IN he/PRP can/MD help/VB the/DT world's/NNS poor/JJ just/RB a/DT little/JJ then/RB it/PRP shows/VBZ politics/NNS isn't/NN worthless./NN
But/CC is/VBZ his/PRP$ vision/NN for/IN Africa/NNP too/RB grand?/NN Can/MD poverty/VB in/IN the/DT continent/NN really/RB be/VB halved?/NN Brown/NNP replies/VBZ that/IN no/DT one/NN thought/VBD the/DT Berlin/NNP Wall/NNP would/MD ever/RB come/VB down/RP either./NN
He's/NNP still/RB got/VBD to/TO overcome/VB -/: not/RB only/RB the/DT reluctance/NN of/IN other/JJ finance/NN ministers/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN -/: but/CC also/RB the/DT cynicism/NN of/IN experts/NNS who/WP wonder/VBP whether/IN debt/NN relief/NN will/MD just/RB be/VB squandered/VBN by/IN governments/NNS that/WDT just/RB won't/NN in/IN the/DT end/NN spend/VB wisely./NN
