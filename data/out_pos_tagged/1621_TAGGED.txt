Henson/NN stakes/NNS early/RB Lions/NNP claim/NN

The/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS may/MD be/VB a/DT glittering/VBG prize/NN in/IN itself/PRP but/CC every/DT player/NN from/IN the/DT four/CD Home/NNP Unions/NNS will/MD also/RB have/VB one/CD eye/NN on/IN a/DT possible/JJ trip/NN to/TO New/NNP Zealand/NNP with/IN the/DT Lions/NNP this/DT summer./NN

The/DT player/NN who/WP staked/VBD the/DT biggest/JJS claim/NN for/IN a/DT place/NN in/IN the/DT starting/VBG XV/NNP over/IN the/DT weekend/NN was/VBD Gavin/NNP Henson./NNP
He's/NNP very/RB confident./NN
You/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO listen/VB to/TO his/PRP$ interview/NN afterwards/RB -/: he/PRP beamed/VBD with/IN confidence/NN -/: but/CC although/IN there's/NNS an/DT element/NN of/IN arrogance/NN it's/NNS good/JJ arrogance./NN
He/PRP certainly/RB showed/VBD some/DT nice/JJ touches./NN
He/PRP once/RB showed/VBD a/DT clean/JJ pair/NN of/IN heels/NNS to/TO Mathew/NNP Tait/NNP when/WRB he/PRP got/VBD outside/IN him/PRP his/PRP$ defence/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC he/PRP made/VBD some/DT great/JJ kicks/VBZ out/IN of/IN hand./NN
And/CC that's/NNS without/IN even/RB mentioning/VBG his/PRP$ majestic/JJ match-winning/JJ penalty./NN
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO wait/VB and/CC see/VB what/WP happens/VBZ because/IN he/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB put/VBN to/TO the/DT test./NN
He/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO come/VB up/RP against/IN Brian/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP or/CC a/DT big/JJ French/JJ midfield./NN
Wales/NNP fly-half/JJ Stephen/NNP Jones/NNP was/VBD another/DT player/NN who/WP impressed/VBD me./NN
He/PRP gave/VBD good/JJ direction/NN he/PRP was/VBD very/RB confident/JJ and/CC he/PRP was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ general/NN for/IN his/PRP$ side./NN
He/PRP showed/VBD he/PRP can/MD control/VB a/DT game./NN
With/IN Jonny/NNP Wilkinson/NNP not/RB playing/VBG at/IN the/DT moment/NN due/JJ to/TO inury/NN the/DT number/NN 10/CD shirt/NN could/MD be/VB up/RP for/IN grabs/NNS and/CC Jones/NNP or/CC maybe/RB even/RB Henson/NNP could/MD make/VB the/DT Lions/NNP team/NN at/IN fly-half./JJ

Jones/NNP stuck/VBD his/PRP$ hand/NN up/RP and/CC he/PRP certainly/RB looks/VBZ a/DT better/JJR bet/NN than/IN Charlie/NNP Hodgson/NNP after/IN Saturday's/NNP game./NN
Some/DT of/IN the/DT Wales/NNP forwards/RB surprised/VBD me/PRP because/IN I/PRP thought/VBD they/PRP would/MD be/VB out-muscled/JJ in/IN the/DT tight/JJ five./NN
England/NNP prop/VB Julian/NNP White/NNP is/VBZ a/DT capable/JJ player/NN but/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ down/RB to/TO selection/VB Gethin/NNP Jenkins/NNP is/VBZ now/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB the/DT upper/JJ hand/NN because/IN he/PRP came/VBD out/RP on/IN top./NN
However/RB I/PRP still/RB think/VBP White/NNP and/CC Phil/NNP Vickery/NNP will/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT frame./NN
Some/DT English/JJ players/NNS did/VBD their/PRP$ cause/NN no/DT harm./NN
I/PRP thought/VBD Joe/NNP Worsley/NNP had/VBD a/DT solid/JJ game/NN and/CC Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP and/CC Josh/NNP Lewsey/NNP both/DT did/VBD nothing/NN wrong./NN
But/CC it/PRP looked/VBD too/RB soon/RB for/IN young/JJ Mathew/NNP Tait/NNP and/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT while/NN before/IN we/PRP see/VBP him/PRP again./VB
Despite/IN being/VBG written/VBN off/RP beforehand/RB several/JJ Scots/NNP caught/VBD my/PRP$ eye/NN against/IN France./NNP

Tom/NNP Smith/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN there/RB and/CC done/VBD it/PRP before/IN but/CC the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Chris/NNP Cusiter/NNP Jason/NNP White/NNP and/CC Ally/NN Hogg/NNP all/DT made/VBN their/PRP$ mark./NN
Hogg/NNP made/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN good/JJ runs/NNS while/IN White/NNP had/VBD a/DT pretty/RB robust/JJ game/NN -/: his/PRP$ defence/NN is/VBZ right/JJ up/RP there./NN
Cusiter/NNP looked/VBD very/RB lively/JJ and/CC he/PRP could/MD be/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ option/NN for/IN Lions/NNP coach/NN Sir/NNP Clive/NNP Woodward./NNP
The/DT star/NN of/IN Ireland's/NNP win/VB over/IN Italy/NNP in/IN Rome/NNP looks/VBZ like/IN a/DT certainty/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT starting/VBG XV/NNP against/IN New/NNP Zealand./NNP
Brian/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP is/VBZ a/DT class/NN act./NN
He/PRP ran/VBD some/DT good/JJ lines/NNS against/IN Italy/NNP made/VBD the/DT breaks/NNS and/CC fed/VBD his/PRP outside/IN backs/VBZ although/IN Italy/NNP defended/VBD man/NN on/IN man/NN which/WDT made/VBD it/PRP easy/JJ for/IN him./NN
Gordon/NNP D'Arcy/NNP was/VBD unlucky/JJ to/TO go/VB off/RP injured/VBN early/RB on/IN but/CC I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP could/MD get/VB a/DT Henson/NNP D'Arcy/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP combination/NN in/IN the/DT Lions/NNP midfield./NN
Paul/NNP O'Connell/NNP just/RB needs/VBZ to/TO add/VB a/DT hard/JJ edge/NN to/TO his/PRP$ game/NN and/CC Malcolm/NNP O'Kelly/NNP keeps/VBZ on/IN going/VBG and/CC seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB putting/VBG his/PRP$ hand/NN up/RP while/IN Shane/NNP Byrne/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT lively/JJ character./NN
But/CC they/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN worried/VBN after/IN the/DT Italian/JJ pack/NN drove/VBD them/PRP off/RP their/PRP$ own/JJ ball/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP although/IN I/PRP used/VBD to/TO play/VB in/IN Italy/NNP and/CC I/PRP know/VBP how/WRB difficult/JJ it/PRP can/MD be./VB
One/CD player/NN who/WP didn't/VBP impress/NN me/PRP was/VBD Wales/NNP scrum-half/JJ Dwayne/NNP Peel./NNP
He/PRP choked/VBD late/RB on/RP in/IN the/DT second/JJ half/NN when/WRB Wales/NNP were/VBD trailing./NN
They/PRP had/VBD good/JJ possession/NN and/CC he/PRP kicked/VBD the/DT ball/NN away/RB -/: I/PRP wouldn't/VBP want/VBP him/PRP as/IN my/PRP$ Lions/NNP scrum-half/JJ after/IN that./NN
