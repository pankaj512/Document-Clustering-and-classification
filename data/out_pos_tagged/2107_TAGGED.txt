Games/NNS help/VBP you/PRP 'learn/VBP and/CC play'/NN

'God/NN games'/NN in/IN which/WDT players/NNS must/MD control/VB virtual/JJ people/NNS and/CC societies/NNS could/MD be/VB educational/JJ says/VBZ research./NN

A/DT US/PRP researcher/VBP has/VBZ suggested/VBN that/WDT games/NNS such/JJ as/IN The/DT Sims/NNP could/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ way/NN to/TO teach/VB languages./NN
Ravi/NNP Purushotma/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN the/DT world/NN of/IN The/DT Sims/NNP can/MD do/VB a/DT better/JJR job/NN of/IN teaching/NN vocabulary/NN and/CC grammar/NN than/IN traditional/JJ methods./NN
The/DT inherent/JJ fun/NN of/IN game/NN playing/VBG could/MD help/VB to/TO make/VB learning/VBG languages/NNS much/RB less/JJR of/IN a/DT chore/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Purushotma./NNP

There/EX must/MD be/VB few/JJ parents/NNS or/CC teachers/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB worry/VB that/IN the/DT lure/NN of/IN a/DT video/NN game/NN on/IN a/DT computer/NN or/CC console/NN is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO resist/VB by/IN children/NNS that/WDT really/RB should/MD be/VB doing/VBG their/PRP$ homework./NN
But/CC instead/RB of/IN fearing/VBG computer/NN games/NNS Ravi/NNP Purushotma/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN educationalists/NNS particularly/RB language/VBP teachers/NNS should/MD embrace/VB games./NN
"One/NN goal/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO break/VB what/WP I/PRP believe/VBP to/TO be/VB the/DT false/JJ assumption/NN that/IN learning/VBG and/CC play/VB are/VBP inherently/RB oppositional"/NN he/PRP said./VB
He/PRP believes/VBZ that/IN the/DT "phenomenal/JJ ability"/NN of/IN games/NNS such/JJ as/IN The/DT Sims/NNP and/CC others/NNS to/TO capture/VB the/DT interest/NN of/IN adolescent/JJ audiences/NNS is/VBZ ripe/JJ for/IN exploitation./NN
The/DT hard/JJ part/NN of/IN learning/VBG any/DT language/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Purushotma/NNP were/VBD the/DT basic/JJ parts/NNS of/IN learning/VBG what/WP different/JJ words/NNS refer/VBP to/TO and/CC how/WRB they/PRP are/VBP used/VBN to/TO build/VB up/RP sentences./NN
Boring/JJ lessons/NNS drumming/VBG vocabulary/NN into/IN pupils/NNS couched/VBN in/IN terms/NNS they/PRP do/VBP not/RB understand/VB has/VBZ made/VBN many/JJ languages/NNS far/RB harder/JJR to/TO learn/VB than/IN they/PRP should/MD be./VB
"The/NN way/NN we/PRP often/RB teach/VBP foreign/JJ languages/NNS right/RB now/RB is/VBZ somewhat/RB akin/JJ to/TO learning/VBG to/TO ride/VB a/DT bike/NN by/IN formally/RB studying/VBG gravity"/NN he/PRP said./VB

By/IN contrast/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Purushotma/NNP learning/VBG via/IN something/NN like/IN The/DT Sims/NNP may/MD mean/VB students/NNS do/VBP not/RB feel/VB like/IN they/PRP are/VBP studying/VBG at/IN all./NN
This/DT was/VBD because/IN The/DT Sims/NNP does/VBZ not/RB rely/VB solely/RB on/IN words/NNS to/TO get/VB information/NN across/IN to/TO players./VB
Instead/RB the/DT actions/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ computer/NN controlled/VBN people/NNS and/CC how/WRB they/PRP interact/VBP with/IN their/PRP$ world/NN often/RB makes/VBZ clear/JJ what/WP is/VBZ going/VBG on./NN
The/DT incidental/JJ information/NN about/IN what/WP a/DT Sim/NNP was/VBD doing/VBG could/MD reinforce/VB what/WP a/DT player/NN or/CC student/NN was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB learning/VBG said/VBN Mr/NNP Purushotma./NNP
By/IN contrast/NN many/JJ language/NN lessons/NNS try/VBP to/TO impart/VB information/NN about/IN a/DT tongue/NN with/IN little/JJ context./NN
For/IN instance/NN he/PRP said/VBD in/IN a/DT version/NN of/IN The/DT Sims/NNP adapted/VBD to/TO teach/VB German/JJ if/IN a/DT player/NN misunderstood/VBN what/WP was/VBD meant/VBN by/IN the/DT word/NN "energie"/NN the/DT actions/NNS of/IN a/DT tired/JJ Sim/NNP stumbling/VBG then/RB falling/VBG asleep/JJ would/MD illustrate/VB the/DT meaning./NN
If/IN necessary/JJ detailed/JJ textual/JJ information/NN could/MD be/VB called/VBN upon/IN to/TO aid/VB players'/NN or/CC students'/NN understanding./NN

One/CD of/IN the/DT drawbacks/NNS of/IN The/DT Sims/NNP said/VBD Mr/NNP Purushotma/NNP was/VBD the/DT lack/NN of/IN spoken/VBN language/NN to/TO help/VB people/NNS brush/VBP up/RP on/IN pronunciation./NN
However/RB online/NN versions/NNS of/IN The/DT Sims/NNP in/IN which/WDT people/NNS have/VBP to/TO move/VB in/IN meet/VBP the/DT neighbours/NNS and/CC get/VB to/TO know/VB the/DT local/JJ town/NN could/MD be/VB adapted/VBN to/TO help/VB this./VB
Although/IN not/RB wishing/VBG to/TO claim/VB that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ to/TO suggest/VB using/VBG a/DT game/NN can/MD help/VB people/NNS learn/VB Mr/NNP Purushotma/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN educationalists/NNS have/VBP missed/VBN the/DT potential/JJ they/PRP have/VBP to/TO help./VB

Getting/VBG a/DT simulated/JJ person/NN to/TO perform/VB everyday/JJ activities/NNS in/IN a/DT make-believe/JJ world/NN and/CC having/VBG them/PRP described/VBD in/IN a/DT foreign/JJ language/NN could/MD be/VB a/DT powerful/JJ learning/NN aid/NN he/PRP believes./VB
Before/IN now/RB he/PRP said/VBD educational/JJ software/NN titles/NNS suffer/VBP by/IN comparison/NN with/IN the/DT slick/JJ graphics/NNS and/CC rich/JJ worlds/NNS found/VBN in/IN games./NN
But/CC he/PRP said/VBD using/VBG pre-prepared/JJ game/NN worlds/NNS such/JJ as/IN The/DT Sims/NNP has/VBZ never/RB been/VBN easier/JJR because/IN tools/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ creators/NNS and/CC fans/NNS that/WDT make/VBP it/PRP easy/JJ to/TO modify/VB almost/RB any/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT game./NN
This/DT could/MD make/VB it/PRP easy/JJ for/IN teachers/NNS to/TO adapt/VB parts/NNS of/IN the/DT game/NN for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ lessons./NN
"I'm/NN hoping/VBG now/RB to/TO re-create/VB a/DT well-polished/JJ German/JJ learning/NN mod/NN for/IN the/DT sequel/NN by/IN this/DT summer"/NN he/PRP told/VBD the/DT BBC/NNP News/NNP website./NN
"I'm/NN encouraged/VBN to/TO hear/VB that/IN others/NNS are/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN experimenting/VBG with/IN Japanese/JJ and/CC Spanish."/NNP Earlier/JJR work/NN with/IN a/DT colleague/NN on/IN using/VBG Civilisation/NNP III/NNP to/TO teach/VB students/NNS about/IN history/NN showed/VBD that/IN it/PRP could/MD be/VB a/DT powerful/JJ way/NN to/TO get/VB them/PRP to/TO realise/VB that/IN solving/VBG a/DT society's/NNS problems/NNS can/MD not/RB always/RB come/VB from/IN making/VBG a/DT single/JJ change./NN
A/DT report/NN on/IN the/DT experiment/NN said/VBD "Students/NN began/VBD asking/VBG historical/JJ and/CC geographical/JJ questions/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN game/NN play/NN using/VBG geography/NN and/CC history/NN as/IN tools/NNS for/IN their/PRP$ game/NN and/CC drawing/VBG inferences/NNS about/IN social/JJ phenomena/NNS based/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ play."/NN Mr/NNP Purushotma's/NNP ideas/NNS were/VBD aired/VBN in/IN an/DT article/NN for/IN the/DT journal/NN Language/NN Learning/NNP and/CC Technology./NNP
