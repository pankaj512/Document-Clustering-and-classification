UKIP's/NNP secret/JJ weapon?/NN

By/IN any/DT measure/NN New/NNP Yorker/NNP Dick/NNP Morris/NNP is/VBZ that/DT thing/NN Americans/NNPS love/NN over/IN everything/NN else/RB -/: a/DT winner./NN

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT man/NN who/WP some/DT pundits/NNS believe/VBP was/VBD almost/RB single-handedly/RB responsible/JJ for/IN Bill/NNP Clinton's/NNP sensational/JJ 1992/CD comeback/NN victory./NN
But/CC Morris/NNP is/VBZ no/DT ideologue./NN
He/PRP has/VBZ worked/VBN as/IN election/NN strategist/NN for/IN any/DT number/NN of/IN Republicans/NNPS as/IN well/RB and/CC more/RBR recently/RB politicians/NNS from/IN Mexico/NNP to/TO Uruguay./NNP
Now/RB he/PRP is/VBZ back/RB in/IN London/NNP as/IN the/DT UK/NNP Independence/NNP Party's/NNP not-so-secret/JJ electoral/JJ weapon/NN after/IN returning/VBG from/IN the/DT Ukraine/NNP where/WRB he/PRP helped/VBD -/: you/PRP guessed/VBD it/PRP -/: opposition/NN candidate/NN Viktor/NNP Yushchenko./NNP
If/IN there/EX is/VBZ one/CD regular/JJ criticism/NN levelled/VBN at/IN Morris/NNP it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ too/RB ready/JJ to/TO switch/VB allegiances./NN
That/DT he/PRP enjoys/VBZ the/DT game/NN more/JJR than/IN the/DT politics./NN

So/RB why/WRB Britain/NNP and/CC why/WRB UKIP/NNP which/WDT despite/IN its/PRP$ recent/JJ EU/NNP election/NN successes/NNS is/VBZ not/RB likely/JJ to/TO pull/VB off/RP a/DT sensational/JJ victory/NN in/IN the/DT looming/VBG general/JJ election./NN
On/IN this/DT subject/JJ Morris/NNP appears/VBZ almost/RB evangelical./NN

"I/NN was/VBD on/IN a/DT cruise/NN in/IN the/DT Mediterranean/NNP and/CC coincidentally/RB so/RB was/VBD UKIP/NNP leader/NN Roger/NNP Knapman./NNP
"I/NN had/VBD just/RB written/VBN a/DT piece/NN saying/VBG how/WRB the/DT English/NNP Channel/NNP was/VBD now/RB wider/JJR than/IN the/DT Atlantic/NNP which/WDT he/PRP liked/VBD and/CC it/PRP went/VBD from/IN there"./NN
But/CC what/WP is/VBZ it/PRP about/IN UKIP/NNP that/WDT particularly/RB attracts/VBZ him?/NN Many/JJ might/MD think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ simply/RB another/DT chance/NN to/TO practice/VB his/PRP$ art/NN irrespective/RB of/IN the/DT politics./NN
"I/NN think/VBP the/DT greatest/JJS threat/NN to/TO democracy/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN is/VBZ not/RB terrorism/NN but/CC bureaucratism"./NN
A/DT great/JJ soundbite/NN but/CC a/DT surprise/NN coming/VBG from/IN a/DT New/NNP Yorker/NNP post/NN 11/CD September./NNP
"It/NN is/VBZ the/DT growth/NN of/IN these/DT bodies/NNS composed/VBN of/IN experts/NNS who/WP know/VBP better/JJR who/WP don't/VBP believe/VBP in/IN letting/VBG democracy/NN govern/NN but/CC believe/VBP in/IN letting/VBG the/DT correct/JJ solution/NN be/VB determined./NN
"That's/NN international/JJ bankers/NNS the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP the/DT World/NNP Bank/NNP and/CC primarily/RB the/DT European/NNP Union"./NNP

So/RB he/PRP is/VBZ out/RP to/TO help/VB UKIP/NNP take/VB Britain/NNP out/IN of/IN this/DT organisation/NN which/WDT he/PRP believes/VBZ is/VBZ unreformable/JJ and/CC inherently/RB undemocratic./NN
And/CC he/PRP is/VBZ scathing/JJ of/IN the/DT Tory/NNP party/NN which/WDT he/PRP also/RB appears/VBZ to/TO believe/VB is/VBZ unreformable./NN
"The/NNP Tory/NNP party/NN is/VBZ schizophrenic/JJ about/IN Europe./NNP
But/CC until/IN somebody/NN says/VBZ they/PRP are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO leave/VB the/DT EU/NNP they/PRP can't/VBP possibly/RB re-negotiate/JJ anything/NN (as/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP is/VBZ pledged/VBN to/TO do)./VB
"It's/NN like/IN walking/VBG into/IN a/DT liquor/NN store/NN with/IN a/DT gun/NN to/TO rob/VB it/PRP and/CC saying/VBG 'before/NN I/PRP can/MD proceed/VB with/IN the/DT robbery/NN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO make/VB clear/JJ I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO shoot/VB anybody'"./NN
Possibly/RB a/DT very/RB American/JJ analogy/NN but/CC another/DT great/JJ soundbite./NN
"The/NN basic/JJ point/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT EU/NNP seeks/VBZ political/JJ integration/NN to/TO move/VB the/DT entire/JJ nexus/NN of/IN decision/NN making/VBG away/RB from/IN Britain/NNP -/: and/CC we/PRP oppose/VBP that/IN and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS cannot/NN be/VB trusted/VBN to/TO oppose/VB it"./NN

So/RB is/VBZ UKIP's/NNP job/NN to/TO destroy/VB the/DT Tories/NNPS as/IN former/JJ member/NN Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP once/RB notoriously/RB declared?/NN "No./NN
The/DT aim/NN of/IN UKIP/NNP is/VBZ to/TO withdraw/VB from/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC if/IN it/PRP has/VBZ any/DT relation/NN to/TO the/DT Tories/NNPS it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO stiffen/VB the/DT Tories'/NNP spine/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN by/IN having/VBG a/DT large/JJ enough/RB UKIP/NNP vote/NN so/IN that/IN we/PRP move/VBP the/DT Tories/NNPS in/IN the/DT direction/NN they/PRP are/VBP refusing/VBG to/TO move./VB

"But/NN it's/NNS not/RB just/RB to/TO shift/VB the/DT Tories./NNP
I/PRP think/VBP UKIP/NNP had/VBD a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN Tony/NNP Blair's/NNP decision/NN to/TO hold/VB a/DT referendum/NN on/IN the/DT European/JJ constitution/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP had/VBD a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN his/PRP$ refusal/NN to/TO go/VB into/IN the/DT euro"./NN
And/CC while/IN we/PRP are/VBP on/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP Mr/NNP Morris/NNP despatches/VBZ him/PRP with/IN another/DT of/IN his/PRP$ neat/JJ soundbites./NN
"Robert/NNP Kilroy/NNP Silk/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT team/NN player/NN -/: it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ idea/NN our/PRP$ party/NN stands/VBZ for/IN some/DT thing/NN and/CC not/RB some/DT one"./NN

So/RB what/WP is/VBZ the/DT big/JJ plan/NN for/IN the/DT general/JJ election./NN
How/WRB will/MD he/PRP achieve/VB the/DT breakthrough?/NN "Look/NN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB forming/VBG the/DT next/JJ government"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Neither/DT does/VBZ UKIP/NNP have/VB to/TO fight/VB every/DT seat./NN
As/IN with/IN the/DT 2004/CD US/PRP presidential/JJ election/NN he/PRP says/VBZ the/DT outcome/NN will/MD be/VB decided/VBN by/IN a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN swing/NN seats/NNS -/: just/RB as/IN he/PRP believes/VBZ it/PRP will/MD in/IN Britain./NNP
So/RB with/IN limited/JJ resources/NNS the/DT aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO target/VB those/DT seats/NNS and/CC end/VB the/DT day/NN with/IN a/DT significant/JJ group/NN in/IN the/DT Commons./NNP
He/PRP also/RB believes/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ the/DT internet/NN could/MD have/VB a/DT big/JJ part/NN in/IN the/DT poll./NN
"The/NN internet/NN was/VBD a/DT decisive/JJ factor/NN in/IN the/DT 2004/CD presidential/JJ election/NN -/: through/IN blogs/NNS (individuals/NN posting/VBG their/PRP$ views/NNS in/IN online/NN diaries)./NN
People/NNS just/RB did/VBD it"./NN
"Anything/VBG can/MD happen/VB in/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election./NN
There/EX is/VBZ an/DT inherent/JJ instability/NN at/IN the/DT moment./NN
"Labour/NN and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS have/VBP drawn/VBN the/DT consensus/NN so/RB tightly/RB and/CC to/TO the/DT left/NN there/EX is/VBZ room/NN for/IN another/DT voice"./NN

That/DT might/MD he/PRP suggests/VBZ lead/VB to/TO a/DT hung/VBN parliament/NN with/IN UKIP/NNP and/CC others/NNS holding/VBG the/DT balance/NN of/IN power./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT huge/JJ task/NN surely./NN
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB a/DT sense/NN that/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election/NN may/MD indeed/RB produce/VB some/DT surprises/NNS -/: even/RB while/IN most/RBS still/RB believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ Labour's/NNP for/IN the/DT taking./NN
UKIP's/NNP performance/NN in/IN last/JJ year's/NNS European/JJ elections/NNS was/VBD just/RB such/PDT a/DT shocker/NN and/CC showed/VBD that/IN Mr/NNP Morris/NNP may/MD have/VB a/DT point/NN about/IN the/DT new/JJ consensus./NN
And/CC after/IN all/DT he/PRP has/VBZ a/DT reputation/NN to/TO sustain./VB
