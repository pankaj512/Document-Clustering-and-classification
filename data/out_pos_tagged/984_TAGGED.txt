The/DT parties/NNS say/VBP they/PRP can/MD stick/VB to/TO the/DT rules/NNS by/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN their/PRP$ calls/NNS are/VBP not/RB marketing/NN -/: for/IN instance/NN by/IN asking/VBG about/IN people's/NNS voting/NN intentions./NN

The/DT rules/NNS on/IN marketing/NN calls/VBZ apply/VB as/RB much/JJ to/TO politicians/NNS as/IN to/TO private/JJ sector/NN companies./NN
But/CC that/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS are/VBP not/RB calling/VBG people/NNS signed/VBD up/IN to/TO the/DT TPS./NNP

A/DT Conservative/JJ spokeswoman/NN said/VBD the/DT party/NN stuck/VBN to/TO the/DT rules/NNS when/WRB it/PRP rang/VBD TPS/NNP subscribers./NN
She/PRP said/VBD "We/NN do/VBP apply/VB TPS/NNP but/CC in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT law./NN
We/PRP would/MD not/RB do/VB things/NNS that/WDT are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN in/IN the/DT law."/NN A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN the/DT Information/NNP Commissioner's/NNP Office/NNP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB classed/VBN as/IN marketing/NN if/IN political/JJ parties/NNS telephoned/VBD people/NNS to/TO encourage/VB them/PRP to/TO vote/VB for/IN them./NN
But/CC the/DT rules/NNS did/VBD allow/VB polling/NN organisations/NNS to/TO telephone/VB people/NNS about/IN their/PRP$ voting/NN intentions/NNS if/IN they/PRP recorded/VBD them/PRP only/RB as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT bigger/RBR set/NN of/IN statistics/NNS not/RB person/VBP by/IN person./NN
"If/NN a/DT political/JJ party/NN was/VBD doing/VBG that/IN than/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB that/IN also/RB would/MD not/RB be/VB marketing"/NN he/PRP said./VB

The/DT spokesman/NN said/VBD it/PRP might/MD be/VB considered/VBN unsolicited/JJ marketing/NN if/IN a/DT party/NN recorded/VBD voting/NN preferences/NNS with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO marketing/NN information/NN in/IN the/DT future./NN
The/DT spokesman/NN said/VBD there/EX was/VBD "no/NN yes/UH or/CC no"/NN answer/NN and/CC the/DT area/NN was/VBD "pretty/NN grey"./NN
He/PRP added/VBD "If/NN someone/NN complained/VBD then/RB we/PRP would/MD investigate/VB that./NN
Political/NN parties/NNS are/VBP aware/JJ of/IN the/DT regulations./NN
At/IN the/DT last/JJ by-elections/NNS we/PRP reminded/VBD them."/NN Lib/NNP Dem/NNP chairman/NN Matthew/NNP Taylor/NNP has/VBZ now/RB written/VBN to/TO the/DT watchdog/NN saying/VBG "The/NN advice/NN we/PRP have/VBP received/VBN on/IN several/JJ previous/JJ occasions/NNS is/VBZ that/IN such/JJ phone/NN calls/NNS are/VBP illegal."/NN He/PRP says/VBZ evidence/NN from/IN local/JJ Lib/NNP Dem/NNP parties/NNS around/IN the/DT country/NN suggests/VBZ there/EX are/VBP "significant"/NN numbers/NNS of/IN such/JJ calls./NN
