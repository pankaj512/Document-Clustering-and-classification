Howard's/NNP unfinished/JJ business/NN

"He's/NN not/RB finished/VBD yet"/NN whispered/VBD the/DT Conservative/JJ Party/NNP person/NN as/IN your/PRP$ reporter/NN attempted/VBN to/TO slip/VB quietly/RB from/IN the/DT hall./NN
And/CC indeed/RB he/PRP wasn't./VB
Michael/NNP Howard/NNP had/VBD already/RB broken/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT printed/VBN text/NN of/IN his/PRP$ speech/NN at/IN his/PRP$ party's/NNS spring/NN conference/NN in/IN Brighton/NNP to/TO deliver/VB a/DT smart/JJ rebuff/NN to/TO Peter/NNP Hain's/NNP description/NN of/IN him/PRP as/IN an/DT "attack/NN mongrel"/NN claiming/VBG such/JJ personal/JJ abuse/NN meant/VBN Labour/NNP was/VBD "rattled"/NN by/IN the/DT Tory/NNP challenge./NN
And/CC here/RB he/PRP was/VBD again/RB moving/VBG to/TO the/DT front/NN of/IN the/DT stage/NN as/IN the/DT party/NN faithful/NN rose/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ feet/NNS in/IN applause/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT personal/JJ ad-libbed/JJ appeal/NN to/TO them/PRP to/TO go/VB out/RB and/CC fight/NN for/IN victory./NN
"One/NN day/NN you/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO tell/VB your/PRP$ children/NNS and/CC grandchildren/NNS as/IN I/PRP will/MD tell/VB mine/JJ 'I/NN was/VBD there./NN
I/PRP did/VBD my/PRP$ bit./NN
I/PRP played/VBD my/PRP$ part./NN
I/PRP helped/VBD to/TO win/VB that/IN famous/JJ election/NN -/: the/DT election/NN that/WDT transformed/VBD our/PRP$ country/NN for/IN the/DT better'."/NN The/DT speech/NN which/WDT was/VBD peppered/VBN with/IN references/NNS to/TO Mr/NNP Howard's/NNP humble/JJ beginnings/NNS as/IN the/DT "child/NN of/IN immigrants"/NN had/VBD been/VBN introduced/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ son/NN Nick/NNP a/DT trainee/NN vicar/NN who/WP praised/VBD his/PRP$ father's/NNS honesty./NN
"I/NN always/RB know/VB where/WRB I/PRP am/VBP with/IN him/PRP because/IN all/DT my/PRP$ life/NN he/PRP has/VBZ meant/VBN what/WP he/PRP has/VBZ said/VBN to/TO me"/VB he/PRP said./VB
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP was/VBD also/RB joined/VBN on/IN stage/NN by/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN Sandra/NNP daughter/NN Larissa/NNP and/CC stepson/NN Sholto./NNP

The/DT audience's/NNS reaction/NN to/TO all/DT of/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT little/RB muted/JJ by/IN party/NN conference/NN standards./NN

But/CC Mr/NNP Howard's/NNP overall/JJ message/NN -/: that/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS have/VBP Labour/NNP on/IN the/DT run/NN and/CC that/IN they/PRP can/MD win/VB the/DT next/JJ election/NN -/: did/VBD not/RB sound/VB quite/RB as/RB hollow/JJ as/IN it/PRP might/MD have/VB done/VBN six/CD months/NNS ago./NN
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP claimed/VBD with/IN some/DT justification/NN that/IN the/DT Tories'/NNP campaign/NN has/VBZ got/VBD off/RP to/TO a/DT "great/NN start"./NN
They/PRP have/VBP had/VBN Labour/NNP on/IN the/DT back/JJ foot/NN over/IN immigration/NN with/IN Tony/NNP Blair/NNP hastily/RB adding/VBG a/DT sixth/JJ promise/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN to/TO his/PRP$ latest/JJS pledge/NN card/NN and/CC have/VBP even/RB managed/VBN to/TO score/VB points/NNS in/IN traditional/JJ Labour/NNP territory/NN such/JJ as/IN health/NN and/CC education./NN
The/DT stunts/NNS involving/VBG Margaret/NNP Dixon/NNP with/IN her/PRP$ postponed/VBN operation/NN and/CC Maria/NNP Hutchings/NNP with/IN concerns/NNS about/IN her/PRP$ son's/NNS special/JJ needs/VBZ education/NN may/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN to/TO everyone's/NNS taste/NN but/CC they/PRP succeeded/VBD in/IN bringing/VBG the/DT issues/NNS alive/JJ and/CC forcing/VBG Labour/NNP to/TO react./VB
Senior/JJ Tories/NNPS believe/VBP they/PRP are/VBP at/IN long/JJ last/JJ starting/NN to/TO tap/VB into/IN the/DT public/JJ mood/NN cutting/VBG through/IN the/DT background/NN noise/NN to/TO connect/VB with/IN the/DT ordinary/JJ voter./NN
Their/PRP$ latest/JJS poster/NN campaign/NN flags/NNS up/RP a/DT range/NN of/IN policies/NNS from/IN better/JJR school/NN discipline/NN cleaner/JJR hospitals/NNS ("I/NN mean/NN how/WRB hard/JJ is/VBZ it/PRP to/TO keep/VB a/DT hospital/NN clean?")/NN and/CC immigration/NN ("It's/NN not/RB racist/JJ to/TO impose/VB limits/NNS on/IN immigration")/NN -/: under/IN the/DT headline/NN "are/NN you/PRP thinking/VBG what/WP we/PRP are/VBP thinking?"/VBG This/DT they/PRP say/VBP contrasts/VBZ with/IN Labour's/NNP negative/JJ campaigning/NN such/JJ as/IN its/PRP$ now/RB infamous/JJ "flying/NN pigs"/NN poster./NN

Oliver/NNP Letwin/NNP one/CD of/IN the/DT men/NNS lampooned/VBN in/IN the/DT Labour/NNP poster/NN affects/VBZ bewilderment/NN at/IN what/WP he/PRP believes/VBZ is/VBZ Labour's/NNP loss/NN of/IN its/PRP$ once/RB sure/JJ footing/NN on/IN the/DT campaign/NN trail./NN
The/DT Peter/NNP Hain/NNP "mongrel"/NN attack/NN he/PRP says/VBZ is/VBZ just/RB the/DT latest/JJS example/NN of/IN the/DT party/NN getting/VBG the/DT tone/NN wrong/JJ -/: a/DT by-product/NN he/PRP claims/VBZ of/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS setting/VBG the/DT agenda./NN

"I/NN have/VBP to/TO say/VB I/PRP don't/VBP understand/VB what/WP they/PRP are/VBP doing./NN
The/DT Labour/NNP machine/NN appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB in/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN state/NN of/IN shock/NN it/PRP doesn't/NN seem/VBP to/TO know/VB what/WP to/TO do."/VB A/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS of/IN positive/JJ headlines/NNS have/VBP also/RB done/VBN wonders/VBZ for/IN Tory/NNP activists'/NN morale/NN -/: likely/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT crucial/JJ factor/NN at/IN an/DT election/NN which/WDT most/JJS analysts/NNS seem/VBP to/TO agree/VB will/MD hinge/VB on/IN which/WDT party/NN can/MD get/VB their/PRP$ core/NN support/NN out./NN
"It/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT fantastic/JJ few/JJ weeks"/NN said/VBD 20-year-old/JJ politics/NNS student/NN Nick/NNP Vaughan./NNP
"Our/NN policies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN getting/VBG in/IN the/DT media/NNS and/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT sense/NN that/IN we/PRP can/MD win./VB

The/DT Tories/NNPS still/RB have/VBP a/DT mountain/NN climb/NN if/IN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP is/VBZ to/TO walk/VB through/IN the/DT doors/NNS of/IN Number/NN 10./CD
Even/RB allowing/VBG for/IN the/DT natural/JJ bias/NN against/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS in/IN some/DT opinion/NN polls/NNS they/PRP are/VBP still/RB behind/IN when/WRB to/TO have/VB a/DT chance/NN of/IN overturning/VBG Labour's/NNP whopping/JJ majority/NN they/PRP should/MD really/RB be/VB ahead./NN
But/CC as/IN they/PRP gear/VBP up/RP for/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT campaign/NN proper/JJ the/DT party/NN at/IN least/JJS has/VBZ reason/NN to/TO hope/VB that/IN like/IN his/PRP$ Australian/JJ namesake/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP really/RB isn't/NN finished/VBD yet./NN
