Butler/NN launches/NNS attack/NN on/IN Blair/NNP

Former/NNP civil/JJ service/NN chief/NN Lord/NNP Butler/NNP has/VBZ criticised/VBN the/DT way/NN Tony/NNP Blair's/NNP government/NN operates/VBZ accusing/VBG it/PRP of/IN being/VBG obsessed/VBN with/IN headlines./NN

He/PRP also/RB attacked/VBD the/DT way/NN the/DT Iraq/NNP war/NN was/VBD "sold"/NN to/TO the/DT public/JJ with/IN important/JJ warnings/NNS on/IN the/DT strength/NN of/IN the/DT intelligence/NN left/VBD out./NN
Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD Lord/NNP Butler/NNP had/VBD given/VBN the/DT "most/NN damaging/JJ testimony"/NN he/PRP could/MD remember./VB
But/CC Downing/NNP Street/NNP said/VBD Mr/NNP Blair/NNP should/MD be/VB judged/VBN by/IN results/NNS not/RB his/PRP$ style./NN

Lord/NNP Butler/NNP said/VBD Mr/NNP Blair/NNP bypassed/VBD the/DT Cabinet/NNP and/CC relied/VBN instead/RB on/IN small/JJ informal/JJ groups/NNS of/IN advisers/NNS to/TO help/VB him/PRP make/VB decisions./NN
The/DT prime/JJ minister's/NNS official/JJ spokesman/NN said/VBD the/DT Cabinet/NNP was/VBD still/RB used/VBN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT consensus/NN on/IN important/JJ issues./NN
But/CC he/PRP added/VBD "You/NN cannot/NN in/IN a/DT modern/JJ government/NN take/VB every/DT decision/NN in/IN Cabinet./NNP
It's/NNP just/RB not/RB possible."/NN

Lord/NNP Butler/NNP said/VBD the/DT government/NN had/VBD too/RB much/JJ freedom/NN to/TO "bring/VBG in/IN bad/JJ Bills"/NNP and/CC "to/NN do/VBP whatever/WDT it/PRP likes"/NN and/CC it/PRP relied/VBD too/RB much/JJ on/IN the/DT advice/NN of/IN political/JJ appointees./NN
The/DT former/JJ cabinet/NN secretary/NN said/VBD in/IN an/DT interview/NN with/IN The/DT Spectator/NNP magazine/NN "I/NN would/MD be/VB critical/JJ of/IN the/DT present/JJ government/NN in/IN that/DT there/EX is/VBZ too/RB much/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN selling/VBG there/EX is/VBZ too/RB much/JJ central/JJ control/NN and/CC there/EX is/VBZ too/RB little/JJ of/IN what/WP I/PRP would/MD describe/VB as/IN reasoned/VBD deliberation/NN which/WDT brings/VBZ in/IN all/PDT the/DT arguments."/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP described/VBD Lord/NNP Butler's/NNP intervention/NN as/IN "very/NN important"./NN
"This/NN is/VBZ from/IN someone/NN who/WP was/VBD an/DT insider/NN at/IN the/DT very/JJ heart/NN of/IN the/DT Blair/NNP government./NN
"It/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB the/DT most/RBS damaging/JJ testimony/NN I/PRP can/MD ever/RB remember/VB from/IN someone/NN in/IN such/PDT an/DT eminent/JJ position."/NN

Lord/NNP Butler's/NNP report/NN earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN into/IN Iraq/NNP intelligence/NN said/VBD the/DT government's/NNS September/NNP 2002/CD weapons/NNS dossier/NN did/VBD not/RB make/VB clear/JJ intelligence/NN about/IN claims/NNS that/IN Saddam/NNP Hussein/NNP had/VBD stockpiles/NNS of/IN chemical/NN and/CC biological/JJ weapons/NNS was/VBD "very/NN thin"./NN
The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB weakened/VBN ministers'/NN case/NN for/IN war/NN Lord/NNP Butler/NNP said/VBD in/IN his/PRP$ Spectator/NNP interview/NN which/WDT was/VBD conducted/VBN by/IN the/DT magazine's/NNS editor/VBP Conservative/JJ MP/NNP Boris/NNP Johnson./NNP
He/PRP said/VBD "When/NN civil/JJ servants/NNS give/VBP material/NN to/TO ministers/NNS they/PRP say/VBP these/DT are/VBP the/DT conclusions/NNS we've/NN drawn/VBN but/CC we've/NN got/VBD to/TO tell/VB you/PRP the/DT evidence/NN we've/NN got/VBD is/VBZ pretty/RB thin./NN
"Similarly/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP giving/VBG something/NN to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations/NNPS and/CC the/DT country/NN you/PRP should/MD warn/VB them."/NN

Asked/VBN why/WRB he/PRP thought/VBD the/DT warnings/NNS were/VBD not/RB there/EX Lord/NNP Butler/NNP said/VBD "One/NN has/VBZ got/VBD to/TO remember/VB what/WP the/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT dossier/NN was./NN
The/DT purpose/NN of/IN the/DT dossier/NN was/VBD to/TO persuade/VB the/DT British/JJ why/WRB the/DT government/NN thought/VBD Iraq/NNP was/VBD a/DT very/RB serious/JJ threat."/NN

When/WRB asked/VBD whether/IN he/PRP thought/VBD the/DT country/NN was/VBD well-governed/JJ on/IN the/DT whole/JJ he/PRP replied/VBD "Well./NN
I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP are/VBP a/DT country/NN where/WRB we/PRP suffer/VBP very/RB badly/RB from/IN Parliament/NNP not/RB having/VBG sufficient/JJ control/NN over/IN the/DT executive/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB grave/JJ flaw./NN
"We/NN should/MD be/VB breaking/VBG away/RB from/IN the/DT party/NN whip./NN
The/DT executive/NN is/VBZ much/RB too/RB free/JJ to/TO bring/VB in/RP a/DT huge/JJ number/NN of/IN extremely/RB bad/JJ Bills/NNS a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN regulation/NN and/CC to/TO do/VB whatever/WDT it/PRP likes/VBZ -/: and/CC whatever/WDT it/PRP likes/VBZ is/VBZ what/WP will/MD get/VB the/DT best/JJS headlines/NNS tomorrow./NN
"All/NN that/DT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN what/WP is/VBZ bad/JJ government/NN in/IN this/DT country."/NN Lord/NNP Butler's/NNP assessment/NN was/VBD backed/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ predecessor/NN as/IN Cabinet/NNP Secretary/NNP Lord/NNP Armstrong./NNP
Lord/NNP Armstrong/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Two's/NNP Newsnight/NNP "I/NN agree/VBP .../:
there/EX doesn't/NN appear/VBP to/TO be/VB the/DT sort/NN of/IN informed/VBN collective/JJ political/JJ judgement/NN brought/VBN to/TO bear/VB on/IN decision-making/JJ that/IN those/DT affected/VBN by/IN decisions/NNS are/VBP entitled/VBN to/TO expect."/VB Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP deputy/NN leader/NN Menzies/NNP Campbell/NNP said/VBD he/PRP thought/VBD Lord/NNP Butler's/NNP comments/NNS were/VBD "well/NN justified"/NN and/CC Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP style/NN of/IN leadership/NN was/VBD "corrosive/JJ of/IN the/DT whole/JJ system/NN of/IN government"./NN
But/CC Labour/NNP former/JJ minister/NN Jack/NNP Cunningham/NNP accused/VBD Lord/NNP Butler/NNP of/IN basing/VBG his/PRP$ comments/NNS on/IN the/DT first/JJ eight/CD months/NNS of/IN the/DT incoming/JJ Labour/NNP administration/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD cabinet/NN secretary./NN
Mr/NNP Cunningham/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP 4's/CD Today/NN programme/NN "Taken/NN together/RB Robin/NNP Butler's/NNP comments/NNS are/VBP partial/JJ inaccurate/JJ and/CC cannot/NN be/VB taken/VBN as/IN anything/NN other/JJ than/IN politically/RB biased/VBN against/IN the/DT Labour/NNP government."/NN
