Campaign/NNP 'cold/NN calls'/NN questioned/VBD

Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Conservatives/NNS are/VBP still/RB telephoning/VBG the/DT millions/NNS of/IN people/NNS who/WP have/VBP signed/VBN up/RP to/TO make/VB sure/JJ they/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB marketing/NN "cold/NN calls"./NN

The/DT parties/NNS say/VBP they/PRP can/MD stick/VB to/TO the/DT rules/NNS by/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN their/PRP$ calls/NNS are/VBP not/RB marketing/NN -/: for/IN instance/NN by/IN asking/VBG about/IN people's/NNS voting/NN intentions./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP are/VBP asking/VBG the/DT watchdog/NN overseeing/VBG the/DT rules/NNS to/TO stop/VB the/DT calls./NN
The/DT information/NN commissioner's/NNS office/NN says/VBZ surveys/NNS are/VBP allowed/VBN but/CC people/NNS had/VBD to/TO be/VB told/VBN if/IN personal/JJ data/NNS was/VBD kept./NN
Telephone/NNP call/VBP centres/NNS are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO be/VB used/VBN as/RB never/RB before/IN by/IN all/PDT the/DT three/CD major/JJ parties/NNS in/IN the/DT run-up/NN to/TO the/DT general/JJ election./NN

But/CC seven/CD million/CD telephone/NN numbers/NNS are/VBP on/IN the/DT Telephone/NNP Preference/NNP Service/NNP (TPS)/NN lists/NNS which/WDT ban/NN unsolicited/JJ sales/NNS and/CC marketing/NN calls./NN
Both/DT schemes/NNS are/VBP run/VBN by/IN the/DT Direct/NNP Marketing/NNP Association/NNP and/CC backed/VBN by/IN EU/NNP directives/NNS on/IN privacy/NN and/CC electronic/JJ communications./NN

The/DT rules/NNS on/IN marketing/NN calls/VBZ apply/VB as/RB much/JJ to/TO politicians/NNS as/IN to/TO private/JJ sector/NN companies./NN
But/CC that/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS are/VBP not/RB calling/VBG people/NNS signed/VBD up/IN to/TO the/DT TPS./NNP
A/DT Labour/NNP Party/NNP spokesman/NN told/VBD the/DT BBC/NNP News/NNP website/NN the/DT party/NN avoided/VBD those/DT on/IN TPS/NNP lists/NNS when/WRB telephoning/VBG people/NNS about/IN membership/NN or/CC fundraising./NN
But/CC that/WDT did/VBD not/RB happen/VB for/IN "voter/NN identification"/NN calls./NN
"When/NN we/PRP ask/VBP which/WDT party/NN they/PRP will/MD vote/VB for/IN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB marketing/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP very/RB clear/JJ legal/JJ advice/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"So/NN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB covered/VBN by/IN the/DT Telephone/NNP Preference/NN Service."/NNP

He/PRP said/VBD the/DT party/NN always/RB asked/VBD people/NNS if/IN they/PRP would/MD be/VB happy/JJ to/TO be/VB contacted/VBN again/RB and/CC if/IN they/PRP said/VBD no/DT they/PRP were/VBD not/RB rung/VBN again./NN
A/DT Conservative/JJ spokeswoman/NN said/VBD the/DT party/NN stuck/VBN to/TO the/DT rules/NNS when/WRB it/PRP rang/VBD TPS/NNP subscribers./NN
She/PRP said/VBD "We/NN do/VBP apply/VB TPS/NNP but/CC in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT law./NN
We/PRP would/MD not/RB do/VB things/NNS that/WDT are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN in/IN the/DT law."/NN Assistant/NNP information/NN commissioner/NN Phil/NNP Jones/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD classed/VBN as/IN marketing/NN if/IN political/JJ parties/NNS telephoned/VBD people/NNS to/TO encourage/VB them/PRP to/TO vote/VB for/IN them./NN
But/CC "classic/JJ market/NN research"/NN such/JJ as/IN a/DT poll/NN of/IN voter/NN intentions/NNS did/VBD not/RB constitute/VB direct/JJ marketing/NN he/PRP said./VB
"If/NN a/DT party/NN is/VBZ calling/VBG someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ registered/VBN on/IN TPS/NNP and/CC records/VBZ their/PRP$ voting/NN intention/NN with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO using/VBG this/DT information/NN in/IN the/DT future/JJ this/DT should/MD be/VB clear/JJ to/TO the/DT voter/NN concerned"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Jones./NNP
"If/NN a/DT party/NN rings/NNS a/DT person/NN who/WP is/VBZ registered/VBN on/IN TPS/NNP to/TO ask/VB about/IN their/PRP$ voting/NN intention/NN and/CC goes/VBZ on/RP to/TO encourage/VB that/DT voter/NN to/TO support/VB them/PRP the/DT party/NN may/MD well/RB be/VB in/IN breach/NN of/IN the/DT regulations./NN
"In/NN summary/NN whether/IN a/DT party/NN calling/VBG TPS/NNP registered/VBD voters/NNS to/TO check/VB their/PRP$ voting/NN intentions/NNS will/MD breach/VB regulations/NNS will/MD depend/VB on/IN the/DT script/NN used/VBN and/CC whether/IN the/DT script/NN is/VBZ followed."/NN Mr/NNP Jones/NNP said/VBD the/DT watchdog/NN received/VBD "very/NN few/JJ complaints"/NN on/IN the/DT issue./NN

Earlier/RBR Lib/NNP Dem/NNP chairman/NN Matthew/NNP Taylor/NNP wrote/VBD to/TO the/DT watchdog/NN saying/VBG "The/NN advice/NN we/PRP have/VBP received/VBN on/IN several/JJ previous/JJ occasions/NNS is/VBZ that/IN such/JJ phone/NN calls/NNS are/VBP illegal."/NN He/PRP says/VBZ evidence/NN from/IN local/JJ Lib/NNP Dem/NNP parties/NNS around/IN the/DT country/NN suggests/VBZ there/EX are/VBP "significant"/NN numbers/NNS of/IN such/JJ calls./NN
"I/NN hope/NN you/PRP can/MD therefore/RB take/VB swift/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ action/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN this/DT ceases"/NN he/PRP tells/VBZ the/DT commissioner./NN
Mr/NNP Taylor/NNP argues/VBZ there/EX should/MD be/VB new/JJ guidelines/NNS so/IN all/DT parties/NNS can/MD act/VB in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN if/IN the/DT watchdog/NN believes/VBZ the/DT rules/NNS allow/VBP parties/NNS to/TO ring/VB TPS/NNP numbers/NNS about/IN voting/VBG intentions/NNS and/CC later/RB urge/VB those/DT people/NNS to/TO vote/VB for/IN them./NN
