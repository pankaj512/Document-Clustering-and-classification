What/WP really/RB divides/VBZ the/DT parties/NNS

So/RB what/WP is/VBZ the/DT gap/NN between/IN Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS nowadays?/NN

One/CD Starbucks/NNP one/CD Rymans/NNP and/CC one/CD small/JJ Greek/JJ cafe/NN as/IN it/PRP happens./NN
Both/DT parties/NNS have/VBP now/RB completed/VBN their/PRP$ moves/NNS to/TO new/JJ headquarters/NN with/IN Labour/NNP creating/VBG its/PRP$ election/NN hub/NN just/RB three/CD doors/NNS away/RB from/IN the/DT Tories'/NNP new/JJ headquarters/NN in/IN Victoria/NNP Street/NNP just/RB down/IN the/DT road/NN from/IN the/DT Commons./NNP
That/DT should/MD make/VB things/NNS a/DT little/RB easier/JJR if/IN and/CC when/WRB the/DT crack-of-dawn/JJ election/NN press/NN conferences/NNS kick/VBP off./NN
Unlike/IN 2001/CD there/EX should/MD be/VB no/DT need/NN for/IN colleagues/NNS to/TO have/VB taxis/NNS gunning/VBG their/PRP$ engines/NNS outside/IN or/CC to/TO buy/VB scooters/NNS to/TO get/VB themselves/PRP between/IN the/DT tightly-timetabled/JJ events./NN

And/CC to/TO all/DT intents/NNS and/CC purposes/NNS we/PRP already/RB appear/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN that/DT general/JJ election/NN campaign./NN
Certainly/RB the/DT press/NN conference/NN hosted/VBN by/IN election/NN co-ordinator/JJ Alan/NNP Milburn/NNP in/IN the/DT rather/RB compact/JJ new/JJ conference/NN room/NN -/: still/RB smelling/NN of/IN new/JJ carpet/NN and/CC with/IN the/DT garish/NN New/NNP Labour/NNP coffee/NN mugs/NNS as/RB yet/RB unstained/VBN -/: had/VBD all/PDT the/DT hallmarks/NNS of/IN an/DT election/NN event./NN

"Welcome/NN to/TO the/DT unremittingly/RB New/NNP Labour/NNP media/NNS centre"/VBP he/PRP said./VB
And/CC I'll/NNP bet/NN he/PRP hadn't/VB checked/VBN that/IN one/CD with/IN Gordon/NNP Brown./NNP
Along/IN with/IN Work/NN and/CC Pensions/NNS Secretary/NNP Alan/NNP Johnson/NNP and/CC Minister/NNP for/IN Work/NN Jane/NNP Kennedy/NNP he/PRP then/RB went/VBD on/RP to/TO tear/VB into/IN the/DT Tory/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO scrap/VB the/DT New/NNP Deal/NNP welfare-to-work/JJ scheme/NN which/WDT they/PRP claimed/VBD would/MD lead/VB to/TO an/DT increase/NN of/IN almost/RB 300000/CD in/IN unemployment./NN
And/CC they/PRP ridiculed/VBD the/DT claims/NNS made/VBN on/IN Monday/NNP by/IN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP that/IN he/PRP could/MD save/VB £35/CD billion/CD of/IN Labour/NNP waste/NN and/CC inefficiency/NN to/TO spend/VB on/IN public/JJ services/NNS while/IN also/RB offering/NN £4/CD billion/CD of/IN tax/NN cuts./NN
Labour/NNP has/VBZ come/VBN up/RP with/IN a/DT figure/NN of/IN £22/CD billions/NNS worth/NN of/IN efficiency/NN savings/NNS so/RB understandably/RB perhaps/RB believe/VBP Mr/NNP Howard/NNP must/MD be/VB planning/VBG cuts/NNS to/TO squeeze/VB the/DT extra/JJ £13/CD billion./NN
These/DT figures/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT two/CD parties'/NN own/JJ detailed/JJ studies/NNS will/MD be/VB battered/VBN to/TO within/IN an/DT inch/NN of/IN their/PRP$ lives/NNS during/IN the/DT campaign./NN
Wednesday/NNP was/VBD just/RB the/DT start./NN
