Chris/NNP Evans/NNP back/RB on/IN the/DT market/NN

Broadcaster/NNP Chris/NNP Evans/NNP has/VBZ begun/VBN selling/VBG thousands/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ possessions/NNS from/IN a/DT stall/NN in/IN Camden/NNP Market/NNP London./NNP

Evans/NNP perched/VBD on/IN a/DT stool/NN as/IN shoppers/NNS wandered/VBN around/IN the/DT open-fronted/JJ shop/NN packed/VBN with/IN his/PRP$ furniture./NN
Among/IN the/DT items/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ homes/NNS in/IN Los/NNP Angeles/NNP and/CC London/NNP were/VBD countless/JJ sofas/NNS chairs/NNS pictures/NNS beds/NNS and/CC memorabilia/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ past/JJ TV/NN shows./NN
Asked/VBN the/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT sale/NN Evans/NNP said/VBD "I/NN just/RB want/VBP to/TO get/VB rid/VB of/IN it/PRP all/DT it's/NNS just/RB a/DT headache."/NN He/PRP added/VBD "It/NN feels/VBZ good/JJ to/TO be/VB selling/VBG this/DT stuff/NN it's/NNS a/DT weight/NN off/RP my/PRP$ mind./NN
"Look/NN at/IN it/PRP all/DT there's/NNS so/RB much/JJ clutter./NN
I've/NNP enjoyed/VBD every/DT bit/NN of/IN furniture/NN and/CC every/DT poster/NN but/CC it's/NNS not/RB important/JJ anymore."/NN The/DT normally/RB gregarious/JJ Evans/NNP cut/VBD a/DT peculiarly/RB unshowbusiness-like/JJ figure/NN as/IN he/PRP sipped/VBD coffee/NN and/CC smoked/VBN cigarettes/NNS wrapped/VBD in/IN a/DT big/JJ coat/NN and/CC scarf/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN his/PRP$ Aladdin's/NNP cave./NN

However/RB the/DT ostentation/NN of/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT items/NNS on/IN sale/NN painted/VBD a/DT picture/NN of/IN the/DT eccentricity/NN that/WDT endeared/VBD him/PRP to/TO the/DT British/JJ public/NN in/IN shows/NNS such/JJ as/IN Channel/NNP 4's/CD gameshow/NN Don't/NNP Forget/VB Your/PRP$ Toothbrush./NNP
The/DT most/RBS striking/JJ thing/NN about/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT pieces/NNS was/VBD their/PRP$ sheer/JJ size./NN
Sofas/NNS looked/VBD like/IN they/PRP could/MD seat/VB a/DT small/JJ party/NN and/CC a/DT bed/NN seemed/VBD big/JJ enough/RB for/IN four./NN
The/DT elaborate/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT pieces/NNS many/JJ custom-made/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB admired/VBN particularly/RB a/DT huge/JJ red/JJ and/CC gold/NN upholstered/VBN "throne"/NN and/CC a/DT stripy/NN deckchair/NN from/IN the/DT Queen/NNP Mary/NNP liner./NN

To/TO help/VB people/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ browsing/VBG Evans/NNP had/VBD given/VBN the/DT pieces/NNS labels/NNS with/IN not/RB only/RB the/DT price/NN but/CC a/DT helpful/JJ often/RB comic/JJ aside./NN
"Isn't/NN it/PRP great"/NN was/VBD the/DT comment/NN on/IN the/DT £1950/CD throne/NN and/CC "Bob/NN Dylan's/NNP old/JJ sofa/NN -/: honest"/NN was/VBD written/VBN on/IN a/DT dark/JJ wood/NN couch/NN priced/VBD £4250./CD

The/DT prices/NNS were/VBD steep/JJ by/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN people's/NNS standards/NNS but/CC Evans/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD not/RB deterring/VBG shoppers./NN
"I've/NN sold/VBN quite/RB a/DT lot/NN already./NN
Everything/NN here/RB is/VBZ on/IN sale/NN for/IN less/JJR than/IN I/PRP bought/VBD it/PRP for/IN but/CC it's/NNS not/RB really/RB about/IN the/DT money./NN
It's/NNP about/IN getting/VBG rid/JJ of/IN it/PRP all./NN
We've/NN all/DT been/VBN bartering/NN that's/NNS what/WP it's/NNS all/DT about."/NN He/PRP added/VBD that/IN he/PRP was/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO reveal/VB what/WP he/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT money/NN he/PRP was/VBD making./NN
Vintage/JJ TV/NN and/CC film/NN posters/NNS also/RB lined/VBD the/DT walls/NNS including/VBG a/DT rare/JJ portrait/NN of/IN Raquel/NNP Welch/NNP and/CC an/DT original/JJ advertising/NN print/NN from/IN the/DT Benny/NNP Hill/NNP Show./NNP
And/CC almost/RB hidden/VBN at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT lock-up/NN were/VBD the/DT two/CD giant/JJ toothbrushes/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ former/JJ Channel/NNP 4/CD show/NN although/IN these/DT were/VBD not/RB for/IN sale./NN

Despite/IN the/DT sheer/JJ curiosity/NN value/NN of/IN the/DT sale/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT healthy/JJ trickle/NN of/IN interest/NN from/IN the/DT public/JJ rather/RB than/IN the/DT perhaps/RB expected/VBN crowds./NN
Some/DT wandered/VBN in/IN just/RB to/TO browse/VB as/IN they/PRP would/MD any/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ stalls/VBZ not/RB knowing/VBG that/IN it/PRP belonged/VBD to/TO Evans./NNP

Paul/NNP Burgess/NNP said/VBD "I/NN didn't/NN realise./NN
I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD just/RB a/DT load/NN of/IN junk./NN
I/PRP should/MD go/VB back/RB and/CC have/VBP a/DT better/JJR look."/NN But/CC local/JJ resident/NN Francesca/NNP Detakats/NNP came/VBD specially/RB to/TO the/DT stall/NN and/CC left/VBN happy/JJ with/IN her/PRP$ purchase/NN of/IN an/DT original/JJ 1960s/NNS photograph/NN of/IN The/DT Who/WP by/IN David/NNP Wedgburg./NNP
Ms/NNP Detakats/NNP said/VBD she/PRP was/VBD a/DT collector/NN and/CC did/VBD not/RB mind/VB paying/VBG £350/CD for/IN the/DT print./NN
"If/NN you/PRP like/IN something/NN you/PRP don't/VBP really/RB count/NN it/PRP like/IN that"/NN she/PRP said./VBP

Martin/NNP Hellewell/NNP who/WP had/VBD also/RB made/VBN a/DT point/NN of/IN visiting/VBG Evans'/NNP shop/NN said/VBD he/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ idea./NN
"Why/NN not/RB if/IN you've/NN got/VBD stuff/NN to/TO get/VB rid/VB of/IN it's/NNS a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO do/VB it"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Hellewell./NNP
Evans/NNP has/VBZ taken/VBN out/RP the/DT stall/NN with/IN business/NN partner/NN Pete/NNP Winterbottom./NNP
They/PRP plan/VBP to/TO open/VB every/DT day/NN if/IN possible/JJ although/IN Evans/NNP did/VBD not/RB know/VB how/WRB often/RB he/PRP would/MD be/VB there./NN
"We'll/NN stay/NN definitely/RB until/IN Christmas/NNP and/CC then/RB maybe/RB a/DT week/NN after/IN that"/NN said/VBD Evans./NNP
