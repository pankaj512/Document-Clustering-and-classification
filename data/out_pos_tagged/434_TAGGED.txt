Nearly/RB two/CD million/CD people/NNS across/IN Asia/NNP could/MD be/VB thrown/VBN into/IN poverty/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT Indian/NNP Ocean/NNP tsunami/NN the/DT Asian/NNP Development/NNP Bank/NNP (ADB)/NN has/VBZ said./NN

In/IN its/PRP$ first/JJ overview/NN of/IN the/DT disaster/NN the/DT ADB/NNP said/VBD the/DT impact/NN on/IN economic/JJ growth/NN would/MD be/VB slight/JJ because/IN major/JJ cities/NNS and/CC factories/NNS escaped/VBD damage./NN
But/CC the/DT blow/NN to/TO many/JJ low-income/JJ people/NNS could/MD be/VB "enormous"./NN
The/DT Paris/NNP Club/NNP of/IN rich/JJ creditor/NN nations/NNS on/IN Wednesday/NNP offered/VBD to/TO freeze/VB debts/NNS owed/VBN by/IN tsunami-hit/JJ countries./NN

The/DT move/NN was/VBD aimed/VBN at/IN helping/VBG South/JJ Asian/JJ governments/NNS find/VBP budgets/NNS to/TO rebuild/VB devastated/VBN coastal/JJ areas/NNS though/IN so/RB far/RB only/RB Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP Indonesia/NNP and/CC the/DT Seychelles/NNP have/VBP indicated/VBN that/IN they/PRP will/MD take/VB it/PRP up./VBD

Other/JJ countries/NNS believe/VBP their/PRP$ economies/NNS are/VBP strong/JJ enough/RB to/TO cope/VB or/CC wish/VBP to/TO avoid/VB being/VBG viewed/VBN as/IN credit/NN risks./NN
"Poverty/NN is/VBZ potentially/RB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ impact/NN of/IN this/DT natural/JJ disaster"/NN said/VBD ADB/NNP chief/NN economist/NN Ifzal/NNP Ali./NNP
Donor/NN nations/NNS have/VBP promised/VBN to/TO give/VB $717m/CD (Â£379m)/CD in/IN disaster/NN relief/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ six/CD months/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT United/NNP Nations./NNP

There/EX are/VBP 1.9/CD billion/CD people/NNS in/IN Asia/NNP living/VBG on/IN less/JJR than/IN $2/CD a/DT day./NN
The/DT ADB/NNP fears/NNS that/IN 1/CD million/CD Indonesians/NNPS could/MD join/VB them/PRP while/IN in/IN India/NNP just/RB over/IN half/PDT a/DT million/CD people/NNS -/: 645000/CD -/: are/VBP at/IN risk/NN of/IN falling/VBG into/IN poverty./NN
A/DT quarter/NN of/IN a/DT million/CD Sri/NNP Lankans/NNP and/CC 23500/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT Maldives/NNP are/VBP also/RB facing/VBG poverty./NN
In/IN the/DT Maldives/NNP where/WRB 43%/CD of/IN the/DT population/NN already/RB lives/NNS on/IN less/JJR than/IN $2/CD a/DT day/NN this/DT could/MD rise/VB to/TO half./VB
Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP and/CC the/DT Maldives/NNP are/VBP the/DT two/CD countries/NNS the/DT ADB/NNP fears/NNS are/VBP most/JJS at/IN risk/NN of/IN suffering/VBG lasting/JJ economic/JJ damage/NN from/IN the/DT tsunami./NN

Indonesia/NNP Malaysia/NNP Thailand/NNP and/CC India/NNP have/VBP enjoyed/VBN strong/JJ economic/JJ growth/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS which/WDT should/MD cushion/VB them/PRP against/IN reconstruction/NN costs./NN

However/RB it/PRP remains/VBZ too/RB soon/RB to/TO asses/NNS the/DT damage/NN to/TO poor/JJ people's/NNS livelihoods/NNS in/IN Aceh/NNP because/IN it/PRP would/MD depend/VB on/IN how/WRB much/JJ farm/NN land/NN had/VBD been/VBN flooded/VBN by/IN seawater./NN
"This/NN is/VBZ a/DT profoundly/RB tragic/JJ event/NN for/IN the/DT region/NN and/CC for/IN the/DT millions/NNS who/WP are/VBP suffering./NN
But/CC the/DT economies/NNS of/IN the/DT affected/VBN countries/NNS except/IN Sri/NNP Lanka/NNP and/CC the/DT Maldives/NNP should/MD emerge/VB with/IN minimal/JJ damage"/NN the/DT ADB/NNP report/NN said./NN
