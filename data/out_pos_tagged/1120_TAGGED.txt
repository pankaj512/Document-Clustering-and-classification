"It/NN deprives/VBZ the/DT detained/JJ person/NN of/IN the/DT protection/NN a/DT criminal/JJ trial/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO afford."/VB

He/PRP said/VBD the/DT weakness/NN for/IN the/DT government's/NNS case/NN was/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO justify/VB detention/NN without/IN trial/NN for/IN foreign/JJ suspects/NNS -/: but/CC not/RB for/IN British/JJ suspects./NN
Lord/NNP Hoffmann/NNP said/VBD "The/NN real/JJ threat/NN to/TO the/DT life/NN of/IN the/DT nation/NN in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN a/DT people/NNS living/VBG in/IN accordance/NN with/IN its/PRP$ traditional/JJ laws/NNS and/CC political/JJ values/NNS comes/VBZ not/RB from/IN terrorism/NN but/CC from/IN laws/NNS such/JJ as/IN these."/NN But/CC Lord/NNP Walker/NNP of/IN Gestingthorpe/NNP the/DT one/CD law/NN lord/NN to/TO oppose/VB the/DT appeal/NN said/VBD the/DT anti-terror/JJ laws/NNS contained/VBD important/JJ safeguards/NNS against/IN oppression./NN

The/DT commission/NN ruled/VBD on/IN 30/CD July/NNP 2002/CD that/IN the/DT anti-terror/JJ act/NN unjustifiably/RB discriminated/JJ against/IN foreign/JJ nationals/NNS as/IN British/JJ people/NNS could/MD not/RB be/VB held/VBN in/IN the/DT same/JJ way./NN
