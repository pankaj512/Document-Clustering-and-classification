Turkey/NNP is/VBZ to/TO relaunch/VB its/PRP$ currency/NN on/IN Saturday/NNP knocking/VBG six/CD zeros/NNS off/IN the/DT lira/NN in/IN the/DT hope/NN of/IN boosting/VBG trade/NN and/CC powering/VBG its/PRP$ growing/VBG economy./NN

The/DT change/NN will/MD see/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN such/JJ dizzyingly-high/JJ denominations/NNS as/IN five/CD million/CD lira/NN -/: enough/RB for/IN a/DT short/JJ taxi/NN ride/NN -/: and/CC the/DT 20m/CD note/NN worth/JJ $15./CD
These/DT valuations/NNS were/VBD the/DT product/NN of/IN decades/NNS of/IN inflation/NN which/WDT as/RB recently/RB as/IN 2001/CD was/VBD as/RB high/JJ as/IN 70%./CD
Inflation/NN has/VBZ since/IN been/VBN tamed/VBN and/CC economic/JJ prospects/NNS are/VBP improving./NN

The/DT currency/NN -/: officially/RB to/TO be/VB known/VBN as/IN the/DT new/JJ lira/NN -/: will/MD be/VB launched/VBN at/IN midnight/NN on/IN 1/CD January./NNP
From/IN that/DT point/VBP the/DT one-million/JJ lira/NN note/NN will/MD become/VB the/DT new/JJ one-lira/JJ coin./NN
The/DT government/NN hopes/VBZ the/DT change/NN will/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT promise/NN of/IN growing/VBG economic/JJ stability/NN as/IN Turkey/NNP embarks/NNS on/IN the/DT long/JJ process/NN of/IN trying/VBG to/TO join/VB the/DT European/NNP Union./NNP

On/IN an/DT everyday/JJ level/NN it/PRP is/VBZ hoped/VBN the/DT change/NN will/MD stimulate/VB more/RBR international/JJ trade/NN and/CC end/NN confusion/NN among/IN foreign/JJ investors/NNS and/CC Turks/NNPS alike./NN
"The/NN transition/NN to/TO the/DT new/JJ Turkish/JJ lira/NN shows/VBZ clearly/RB that/IN our/PRP$ economy/NN has/VBZ broken/VBN the/DT vicious/JJ circle/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD imprisoned/VBN in/IN for/IN long/JJ years"/NN said/VBD Sureyya/NNP Serdengecti/NNP head/NN of/IN the/DT Turkish/JJ Central/NNP Bank./NNP
"The/NN new/JJ lira/NN is/VBZ also/RB the/DT symbol/NN of/IN the/DT stable/JJ economy/NN that/IN we/PRP dreamed/VBD of/IN for/IN long/RB years."/NN

The/DT Turkish/JJ economy/NN teetered/VBN on/IN the/DT brink/NN of/IN collapse/NN in/IN 2001/CD when/WRB the/DT lira/NN plunged/VBD in/IN value/NN and/CC two/CD million/CD people/NNS lost/VBD their/PRP$ jobs./NN

Turkey/NNP had/VBD to/TO turn/VB to/TO the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP for/IN financial/JJ assistance/NN accepting/VBG a/DT $18bn/CD loan/NN in/IN return/NN for/IN pushing/VBG through/IN a/DT wide-ranging/JJ austerity/NN programme./NN
These/DT tough/JJ measures/NNS have/VBP borne/VBN fruit./NN
Inflation/NN fell/VBD below/IN 10%/CD earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN decades/NNS while/IN exports/NNS are/VBP up/IN 30%/CD this/DT year./NN
Meanwhile/RB the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ expanding/VBG at/IN a/DT healthy/JJ rate/NN with/IN 7.9%/CD growth/NN expected/VBN in/IN 2004./CD
The/DT government/NN hopes/NNS that/IN the/DT new/JJ currency/NN will/MD cement/VB the/DT country's/NNS economic/JJ progress/NN two/CD weeks/NNS after/IN EU/NNP leaders/NNS set/VBD a/DT date/NN for/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN Turkey's/NNP accession/NN talks./NN

The/DT slimmed-down/JJ lira/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB widely/RB welcomed/VBN by/IN the/DT business/NN community./NN

"The/NN Turkish/JJ lira/NN has/VBZ been/VBN like/IN funny/JJ money"/NN Tevfik/NNP Aksoy/NNP chief/NN Turkish/JJ economist/NN for/IN Deutsche/NNP Bank/NNP told/VBD Associated/NNP Press./NNP
"Now/NN at/IN least/JJS in/IN cosmetic/JJ terms/NNS it/PRP will/MD look/VB like/IN real/JJ currency."/NN However/RB some/DT do/VBP not/RB feel/VB quite/RB so/RB happy/JJ about/IN seeing/VBG the/DT nominal/JJ value/NN of/IN their/PRP$ investments/NNS reduced./NN
"If/NN a/DT person/NN has/VBZ 10/CD billion/CD lira/NN in/IN investments/NNS this/DT will/MD suddenly/RB decrease"/VB shop/NN owner/NN Hayriye/NNP Evren/NNP told/VBD Associated/NNP Press./NNP
