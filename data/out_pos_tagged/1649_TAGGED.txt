Corry/NNP backs/VBZ skipper/VB Robinson/NNP

England/NNP forward/RB Martin/NNP Corry/NNP says/VBZ Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP is/VBZ the/DT right/JJ man/NN to/TO lead/VB the/DT national/JJ team/NN back/RB to/TO winning/VBG ways./NN

After/IN losses/NNS to/TO Wales/NNP and/CC France/NNP critics/NNS have/VBP started/VBN to/TO wonder/VB whether/IN Robinson/NNP can/MD captain/VB from/IN full-back./JJ
But/CC Corry/NNP has/VBZ backed/VBN Robinson/NNP who/WP was/VBD given/VBN the/DT role/NN after/IN the/DT injury/NN to/TO fly-half/JJ Jonny/NNP Wilkinson/NNP ahead/RB of/IN this/DT weekend's/NNS trip/NN to/TO Ireland./NNP
"Jason/NN is/VBZ doing/VBG a/DT tremendous/JJ job./NN
Every/DT week/NN my/PRP$ respect/NN for/IN him/PRP goes/VBZ up"/NN Corry/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP Five/CD Live./NNP
"He/NN is/VBZ an/DT inspirational/JJ captain./NN
When/WRB he/PRP talks/VBZ with/IN the/DT squad/NN he/PRP talks/VBZ with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN sense./NN
"The/NN players/NNS have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN respect/NN for/IN him./NN
It's/VBG an/DT honour/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN the/DT England/NNP side/NN and/CC an/DT honour/NN to/TO play/VB under/IN him."/NN

England/NNS are/VBP under/IN immense/JJ pressure/NN following/VBG their/PRP$ poor/JJ start/NN to/TO the/DT year/NN and/CC victory/NN is/VBZ vital/JJ if/IN they/PRP are/VBP to/TO rescue/VB their/PRP$ Six/CD Nations/NNPS campaign./NN
But/CC Corry/NNP insists/VBZ England/NNP are/VBP in/IN the/DT right/JJ frame/NN of/IN mind/NN for/IN the/DT contest./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ apprehension/NN going/VBG into/IN every/DT game"/NN he/PRP added./VB
"But/NN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO use/VB that/DT fear/NN and/CC put/VBD it/PRP into/IN a/DT positive/JJ mindset./NN
"When/NN the/DT whistle/NN goes/VBZ on/IN Sunday/NNP what/WP has/VBZ happened/VBN in/IN the/DT past/JJ does/VBZ not/RB count/VB for/IN anything./NN

"We/NN have/VBP not/RB performed/VBN but/CC if/IN we/PRP put/VBD in/IN a/DT performance/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP then/RB we/PRP can/MD start/VB turning/VBG results/NNS around./NN
"There/NN are/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN changes/NNS taking/VBG place/NN with/IN England/NNP and/CC we/PRP are/VBP at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN something./NN
We/PRP have/VBP not/RB got/VBN off/RP to/TO the/DT greatest/JJS of/IN starts/NNS but/CC you/PRP need/VBP to/TO experience/VB the/DT bad/JJ the/DT before/JJ you/PRP can/MD fully/RB appreciate/VB the/DT good."/NN

A/DT trip/NN to/TO Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP is/VBZ daunting/JJ at/IN any/DT time/NN especially/RB against/IN an/DT Ireland/NNP side/NN that/WDT are/VBP flying/VBG high/JJ after/IN two/CD impressive/JJ wins./NN
They/PRP are/VBP the/DT form/NN team/NN of/IN the/DT tournament/NN and/CC are/VBP tipped/VBN to/TO claim/VB their/PRP$ first/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP since/IN 1948./CD
But/CC Corry/NNP is/VBZ relishing/VBG the/DT prospect/NN of/IN taking/VBG on/RP the/DT Irish/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ backyard./NN
"They/NN are/VBP full/JJ of/IN confidence/NN and/CC are/VBP playing/VBG a/DT great/JJ team/NN game"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"The/NN forwards/RB are/VBP creating/VBG a/DT great/JJ platform/NN and/CC they/PRP have/VBP explosive/JJ runners/NNS out/RP wide./NN
"If/NN you/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT team/NN on/IN paper/NN they/PRP have/VBP stars/NNS from/IN one/CD to/TO 15./CD
It's/VBG a/DT huge/JJ task/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ opportunity/NN for/IN us./NN
"Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP is/VBZ a/DT tremendous/JJ venue/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP to/TO use/VB it/PRP to/TO our/PRP$ advantage."/NN
