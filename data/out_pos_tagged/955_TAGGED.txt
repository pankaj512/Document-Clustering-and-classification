'Debate/NN needed'/NN on/IN donations/NNS cap/NN

A/DT cap/NN on/IN donations/NNS to/TO political/JJ parties/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB introduced/VBN yet/RB the/DT elections/NNS watchdog/NN has/VBZ said./NN

Fears/NNS that/IN big/JJ donors/NNS can/MD buy/VB political/JJ favours/NNS have/VBP sparked/VBN calls/VBZ for/IN a/DT limit./NN
In/IN a/DT new/JJ report/NN the/DT Electoral/JJ Commission/NNP says/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ debating/VBG a/DT £10000/CD cap/NN for/IN the/DT future/JJ but/CC now/RB is/VBZ not/RB the/DT right/JJ time/NN to/TO introduce/VB it./NN
It/PRP also/RB says/VBZ there/EX should/MD be/VB more/JJR state/NN funding/NN for/IN political/JJ parties/NNS and/CC candidates/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO spend/VB more/JJR on/IN election/NN campaigning./NN

There/EX were/VBD almost/RB £68m/CD in/IN reported/VBD donations/NNS to/TO political/JJ parties/NNS in/IN 2001/CD 2002/CD and/CC 2003/CD with/IN nearly/RB £12m/CD of/IN them/PRP from/IN individual/JJ gifts/NNS worth/JJ more/JJR than/IN £1m./CD
The/DT rules/NNS have/VBP already/RB been/VBN changed/VBN so/IN the/DT public/NN can/MD see/VB who/WP gives/VBZ how/WRB much/JJ to/TO the/DT parties/NNS but/CC the/DT report/NN says/VBZ there/EX are/VBP still/RB public/JJ suspicions./NN
The/DT commission/NN says/VBZ capping/VBG donations/NNS would/MD mean/VB taxpayers/NNS giving/VBG parties/NNS more/JJR cash/NN -/: something/NN which/WDT would/MD first/VB have/VB to/TO be/VB acceptable/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN and/CC shown/JJ to/TO work./VB
"While/NN we/PRP are/VBP not/RB in/IN principle/NN opposed/VBN to/TO the/DT introduction/NN of/IN a/DT donation/NN cap/NN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB believe/VB that/IN such/PDT a/DT major/JJ departure/NN from/IN the/DT existing/VBG system/NN now/RB would/MD be/VB sensible"/NN says/VBZ its/PRP$ report./NN
If/IN there/EX was/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT cap/NN it/PRP should/MD be/VB £10000/CD -/: a/DT small/JJ enough/JJ amount/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT difference/NN but/CC which/WDT would/MD have/VB banned/VBN £56m/CD in/IN donations/NNS between/IN 2001/CD and/CC 2003./CD

Even/RB without/IN changes/NNS the/DT commission/NN does/VBZ urge/VB political/JJ parties/NNS to/TO seek/VB out/RP more/RBR small-scale/JJ donations/NNS and/CC suggests/VBZ there/EX should/MD be/VB income/NN tax/NN relief/NN for/IN gifts/NNS under/IN £200./CD
It/PRP also/RB suggests/VBZ increasing/VBG state/NN funding/NN for/IN parties/NNS to/TO £3m/CD so/RB help/VB can/MD be/VB extended/VBN to/TO all/DT parties/NNS with/IN at/IN least/JJS two/CD members/NNS in/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Commons/NNPS European/NNP Parliament/NNP Scottish/NNP Parliament/NNP Welsh/NNP Assembly/NNP or/CC Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP Assembly./NNP
And/CC it/PRP suggests/VBZ new/JJ ways/NNS of/IN boosting/VBG election/NN campaigning/NN seen/VBN as/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN improving/VBG voter/NN turnout./NN
All/DT local/JJ election/NN candidates/NNS should/MD be/VB entitled/VBN to/TO a/DT free/JJ mailshot/NN for/IN campaign/NN leaflets/NNS says/VBZ the/DT watchdog./NN
And/CC there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT shift/NN in/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN money/NN allowed/VBN to/TO be/VB spent/VBN at/IN elections/NNS from/IN a/DT national/JJ level/NN to/TO a/DT local/JJ level/NN to/TO help/VB politicians/NNS engage/VB better/JJR with/IN voters./NN

The/DT report/NN suggests/VBZ doubling/VBG the/DT money/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB spent/VBN by/IN candidates/NNS while/IN cutting/VBG national/JJ spending/NN limits/NNS from/IN £20m/CD to/TO £15m./CD
The/DT commission/NN also/RB says/VBZ the/DT spending/NN limits/NNS for/IN general/JJ elections/NNS should/MD cover/VB the/DT four/CD months/NNS before/IN the/DT poll/NN -/: as/IN happens/VBZ with/IN other/JJ elections./NN
Electoral/JJ Commission/NNP chairman/NN Sam/NNP Younger/JJR said/VBD "There/NN is/VBZ no/DT doubt/NN that/IN political/JJ parties/NNS have/VBP a/DT vital/JJ role/NN to/TO play/VB in/IN maintaining/VBG the/DT health/NN of/IN our/PRP$ democracy/NN and/CC for/IN this/DT they/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB adequately/RB resourced./NN
"Our/NN research/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN people/NNS want/VBP to/TO be/VB more/RBR informed/JJ about/IN party/NN politics/NNS and/CC that/IN they/PRP want/VBP politicians/NNS to/TO be/VB more/RBR visible/JJ and/CC accessible./NN
"The/NN public/JJ are/VBP reluctant/JJ for/IN the/DT state/NN to/TO fund/VB parties/NNS but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN are/VBP unhappy/JJ with/IN large/JJ private/JJ donations."/NN He/PRP called/VBD for/IN a/DT wider/JJR public/JJ debate/NN on/IN party/NN funding/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT consensus/NN needed/VBN for/IN radical/JJ changes/NNS to/TO the/DT current/JJ system./NN
