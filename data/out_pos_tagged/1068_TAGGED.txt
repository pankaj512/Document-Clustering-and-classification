Schools/NNP must/MD improve/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN citizenship/NN lessons/NNS -/: or/CC social/JJ cohesion/NN and/CC democracy/NN will/MD suffer/VB says/VBZ the/DT education/NN watchdog./NN

Independent/NNP faith/NN schools/NNS were/VBD singled/VBN out/RP by/IN Ofsted/NNP chief/NN David/NNP Bell/NNP for/IN not/RB doing/VBG enough/RB to/TO promote/VB the/DT "wider/NN tenets/NNS of/IN British/JJ society"./NN
Mr/NNP Bell/NNP said/VBD Muslim/NNP Jewish/JJ and/CC Evangelical/NNP Christian/NNP schools/NNS must/MD be/VB "intolerant/NN of/IN intolerance"./NN
Diversity/NN "certainly/RB must/MD not/RB mean/VB segregated/VBD or/CC separate"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Mr/NNP Bell's/NNP speech/NN called/VBN for/IN a/DT much/RB greater/JJR effort/NN in/IN all/DT types/NNS of/IN schools/NNS to/TO teach/VB citizenship/NN -/: with/IN an/DT accompanying/VBG survey/NN showing/VBG that/IN young/JJ people/NNS knew/VBD little/RB about/IN politics/NNS and/CC had/VBD no/DT enthusiasm/NN to/TO find/VB out/RP more./NN

Badly-taught/NNP citizenship/NN lessons/NNS have/VBP previously/RB been/VBN criticised/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Bell/NNP and/CC in/IN a/DT speech/NN to/TO the/DT Hansard/NNP Society/NNP he/PRP warned/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD failing/VBG to/TO pass/VB on/IN an/DT understanding/NN of/IN democracy/NN public/JJ service/NN and/CC shared/VBN values./NN
He/PRP highlighted/VBD his/PRP$ particular/JJ concern/NN for/IN citizenship/NN in/IN the/DT growing/VBG number/NN of/IN independent/JJ faith/NN schools/NNS -/: which/WDT he/PRP said/VBD included/VBD about/RB 100/CD Muslim/NNP 100/CD Evangelical/NNP Christian/NNP and/CC 50/CD Jewish/JJ schools./NN

Mr/NNP Bell/NNP expressed/VBD concern/NN about/IN schools/NNS which/WDT did/VBD not/RB teach/VB children/NNS enough/RB about/IN a/DT "common/NN heritage"/NN and/CC needed/VBN to/TO do/VB more/JJR to/TO promote/VB principles/NNS of/IN mutual/JJ tolerance/NN and/CC social/JJ inclusion./NN
"I/NN worry/VBP that/IN many/JJ young/JJ people/NNS are/VBP being/VBG educated/VBN in/IN faith-based/JJ schools/NNS with/IN little/JJ appreciation/NN of/IN their/PRP$ wider/JJR responsibilities/NNS and/CC obligations/NNS to/TO British/JJ society"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Bell./NNP
The/DT Ofsted/NNP chief/NN said/VBD his/PRP$ forthcoming/JJ annual/JJ report/NN would/MD make/VB particular/JJ reference/NN to/TO Muslim/NNP schools./NN
"Many/NN must/MD adapt/VB their/PRP$ curriculum/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ pupils/NNS with/IN a/DT broad/JJ general/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN public/JJ institutions/NNS and/CC services/NNS in/IN England/NNP and/CC helps/VBZ them/PRP to/TO acquire/VB an/DT appreciation/NN of/IN and/CC respect/NN for/IN other/JJ cultures/NNS in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT promotes/VBZ tolerance/NN and/CC harmony."/NN Mr/NNP Bell/NNP said/VBD such/JJ questions/NNS of/IN religion/NN and/CC cultural/JJ identity/NN were/VBD "tricky/JJ issues"./NN
But/CC he/PRP argued/VBD that/IN "we/NN must/MD not/RB allow/VB our/PRP$ recognition/NN of/IN diversity/NN to/TO become/VB apathy/NN in/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN any/DT challenge/NN to/TO our/PRP$ coherence/NN as/IN a/DT nation"./NN
"I/NN would/MD go/VB further/RBR and/CC say/VB that/IN an/DT awareness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ common/JJ heritage/NN as/IN British/JJ citizens/NNS equal/JJ under/IN the/DT law/NN should/MD enable/VB us/PRP to/TO assert/VB with/IN confidence/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP intolerant/NN of/IN intolerance/NN illiberalism/NN and/CC attitudes/NNS and/CC values/NNS that/DT demean/VBP the/DT place/NN of/IN certain/JJ sections/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ community/NN be/VB they/PRP women/NNS or/CC people/NNS living/VBG in/IN non-traditional/JJ relationships"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Bell./NNP
