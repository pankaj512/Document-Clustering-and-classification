Trouble/NN flared/VBN at/IN a/DT ruck/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN of/IN Wales'/NNP 11-9/JJ win/NN in/IN Cardiff/NNP as/IN Grewcock/NNP came/VBD recklessly/RB over/IN the/DT top/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ boot/NN leaving/VBG Peel/NNP bloodied./NN
Grewcock/NNP was/VBD sin-binned/JJ with/IN Wales/NNP captain/NN Gareth/NNP Thomas/NNP for/IN retaliation./NN
"It's/NN up/IN to/TO the/DT citing/VBG commissioner"/NN said/VBD Ruddock./NNP
"I'm/NN not/RB saying/VBG it's/NNS deliberate/VBP but/CC Grewcock/NNP did/VBD a/DT similar/JJ thing/NN for/IN Bath/NN against/IN Leinster."/NNP Last/JJ June/NNP Grewcock/NNP was/VBD banned/VBN from/IN rugby/NN for/IN two/CD months/NNS for/IN reckless/JJ use/NN of/IN a/DT boot/NN in/IN a/DT match/NN against/IN New/NNP Zealand./NNP

Six/CD years/NNS earlier/RBR also/RB in/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP Grewcock/NNP became/VBD only/RB the/DT second/JJ England/NNP player/NN to/TO be/VB sent/VBN off/RP in/IN Tests./NNP
The/DT player/NN himself/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ captain/NN Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP have/VBP both/DT said/VBN that/IN the/DT clash/NN with/IN Peel/NNP was/VBD accidental./NN
"If/NN the/DT ball/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN the/DT ruck/NN and/CC I/PRP feel/VBP I/PRP can/MD step/VB over/RB and/CC disrupt/VB it/PRP then/RB I/PRP will/MD do/VB that"/NN said/VBD Grewcock./NNP
But/CC Ruddock/NNP feels/VBZ that/IN the/DT England/NNP man/NN should/MD be/VB more/JJR careful./NN
"The/NN boy/NN himself/PRP should/MD look/VB at/IN his/PRP$ actions/NNS it/PRP was/VBD a/DT clumsy/JJ piece/NN of/IN footwork"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"He's/NN a/DT great/JJ player/NN and/CC I/PRP don't/VBP want/VBP to/TO knock/VB him/PRP we/PRP won't/VBP be/VB calling/VBG for/IN the/DT match/NN commissioner/NN to/TO review/VB the/DT incident./NN
"I'm/NN not/RB going/VBG to/TO go/VB too/RB far/RB with/IN the/DT lad./NN
It/PRP could/MD just/RB be/VB a/DT clumsy/JJ action/NN and/CC Dwayne/NNP had/VBD just/RB a/DT minor/JJ cut./NN
"The/NN referee's/NNS interpretation/NN was/VBD that/IN Grewcock/NNP was/VBD attempting/VBG to/TO step/VB over/IN the/DT ruck."/NN Ruddock/NNP also/RB warned/VBD his/PRP$ RBS/NNP 6/CD Nations/NNPS Championship/NNP rivals/NNS that/IN his/PRP$ team/NN can/MD make/VB massive/JJ improvements./NN
"We/NN created/VBD more/JJR opportunities/NNS and/CC also/RB squandered/VBN them/PRP by/IN taking/VBG more/JJR contact/NN and/CC playing/VBG more/JJR individually"/NN said/VBD the/DT coach./NN
"We've/NN looked/VBD through/RB things/NNS on/IN the/DT video/NN debrief/NN and/CC there/EX were/VBD definitely/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN chances/NNS that/IN we/PRP wasted."/VBP In/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ games/NNS Ruddock/NNP may/MD use/VB penalty/NN hero/NN Gavin/NNP Henson/NNP as/IN his/PRP$ first-choice/JJ kicker/NN in/IN place/NN of/IN Stephen/NNP Jones./NNP
"Our/NN first/JJ aim/NN was/VBD to/TO get/VB Gavin/NNP settled/VBD into/IN the/DT team/NN but/CC it's/NNS something/NN we'll/NN talk/NN about/IN in/IN selection/NN this/DT week"/NN said/VBD Ruddock./NNP
