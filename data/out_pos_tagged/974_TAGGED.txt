The/DT trial/NN scheme/NN which/WDT could/MD start/VB in/IN weeks/NNS may/MD be/VB extended/VBN to/TO apply/VB to/TO children/NNS from/IN other/JJ countries./NN
Children's/NN charities/NNS have/VBP reacted/VBN with/IN alarm/NN saying/VBG the/DT policy/NN amounts/VBZ to/TO forcible/JJ removal/NN and/CC may/MD not/RB guarantee/VB the/DT safety/NN of/IN those/DT affected./NN
But/CC the/DT Home/NNP Office/NNP says/VBZ it/PRP may/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT children's/NNS best/JJS interests/NNS if/IN it/PRP reunites/VBZ them/PRP with/IN their/PRP$ communities./NN

The/DT pilot/NN included/VBN in/IN the/DT government's/NNS five-year/JJ immigration/NN plan/NN aims/VBZ to/TO return/VB unaccompanied/VBD asylum-seeking/JJ children/NNS from/IN Albania/NNP who/WP have/VBP failed/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ asylum/NN claims./NN

These/DT children/NNS automatically/RB become/VBP the/DT responsibility/NN of/IN social/JJ services./NN
Up/IN to/TO now/RB ministers/VBZ have/VBP held/VBN back/RB from/IN final/JJ removal/NN orders/NNS against/IN unaccompanied/VBN children/NNS until/IN after/IN they/PRP are/VBP legally/RB adults/NNS at/IN 18./CD
At/IN least/JJS a/DT dozen/NN Albanian-born/NNP teenagers/NNS are/VBP thought/VBN to/TO have/VB been/VBN identified/VBN for/IN return/NN according/VBG to/TO sources/NNS although/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT public/JJ confirmation/NN of/IN numbers./NN
Those/DT selected/VBN could/MD either/RB be/VB returned/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ families/NNS should/MD they/PRP be/VBP traced/VBN or/CC placed/VBN in/IN the/DT care/NN of/IN other/JJ Albanian/NNP authorities./NN

Laura/NNP Brownlees/NNP of/IN Save/NNP the/DT Children/NNP said/VBD there/EX were/VBD grave/JJ concerns/NNS not/RB least/JJS because/IN of/IN the/DT well-documented/JJ trafficking/NN of/IN children/NNS into/IN crime/NN and/CC prostitution/NN in/IN Albania./NNP

"If/NN children/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB returned/VBN then/RB there/EX should/MD be/VB proper/JJ assessments/NNS and/CC decisions/NNS on/IN a/DT case/NN by/IN case/NN basis"/NN she/PRP said./VBP
"We/NN do/VBP not/RB think/VB there/EX are/VBP structures/NNS in/IN place/NN [to/NN receive/NN returning/VBG children/NNS in/IN Albania]./NNP
'If/NN these/DT decisions/NNS are/VBP not/RB in/IN the/DT best/JJS interests/NNS of/IN the/DT child/NN then/RB that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT forced/VBN removal/NN because/IN the/DT child/NN will/MD not/RB have/VB any/DT choice/NN in/IN the/DT final/JJ decision."/NN In/IN its/PRP$ five-year/JJ immigration/NN plan/NN announced/VBD on/IN Tuesday/NNP the/DT government/NN said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD addressing/VBG "the/NN difficult/JJ issue"/NN of/IN returning/VBG unaccompanied/VBN asylum/NN seeking/VBG children./NN
A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN the/DT Home/NNP Office/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD wholly/RB wrong/JJ to/TO suggest/VB that/IN the/DT plan/NN was/VBD to/TO return/VB children/NNS "and/NN leave/NN them/PRP to/TO rot"./VB
"We/NN are/VBP developing/VBG a/DT returns/NNS programme/NN for/IN unaccompanied/VBN asylum-seeking/JJ children/NNS whose/WP$ asylum/NN and/CC humanitarian/JJ protection/NN claims/NNS have/VBP been/VBN refused"/VBG said/VBD the/DT spokesman./NN
"We/NN have/VBP been/VBN exploring/VBG how/WRB we/PRP can/MD establish/VB reception/NN and/CC longer-term/JJ care/NN arrangements/NNS in/IN countries/NNS of/IN origin/NN and/CC believe/VBP that/WDT it's/NNS possible/JJ to/TO return/VB children/NNS in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT is/VBZ in/IN their/PRP$ best/JJS interests/NNS and/CC is/VBZ safe/JJ and/CC sustainable./NN

"From/NN what/WP is/VBZ so/RB far/RB known/VBN we/PRP strongly/RB oppose/VBP the/DT scheme/NN because/IN the/DT welfare/NN and/CC best/JJS interests/NNS of/IN the/DT child/NN will/MD not/RB properly/RB be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Hogg./NNP
