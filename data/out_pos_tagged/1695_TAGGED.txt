Barbarians/NNPS 19-47/JJ New/NNP Zealand/NNP

New/NNP Zealand/NNP proved/VBD too/RB strong/JJ for/IN an/DT Australian-dominated/NNP Barbarians/NNPS to/TO round/VB off/RP their/PRP$ unbeaten/JJ northern/JJ hemisphere/NN tour/NN with/IN an/DT easy/JJ win./NN

Rico/NNP Gear/NNP ran/VBD in/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT All/DT Blacks'/NNP seven/CD tries/VBZ in/IN what/WP was/VBD a/DT predominantly/RB second-string/JJ line-up./JJ

And/CC New/NNP Zealand/NNP coach/NN Graham/NNP Henry/NNP said/VBD "It/NN was/VBD a/DT quality/NN performance/NN against/IN a/DT very/RB experienced/VBN side/NN and/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN young/JJ guys/NNS came/VBD through/IN very/RB well./NN
"They/NN learnt/NN from/IN the/DT older/JJR players/NNS and/CC this/DT was/VBD a/DT way/NN of/IN thanking/VBG the/DT guys/NNS who/WP had/VBD been/VBN mentoring/VBG them/PRP on/IN the/DT tour."/NN But/CC the/DT running/VBG rugby/NN the/DT crowd/NN had/VBD been/VBN hoping/VBG for/IN rarely/RB materialised./NN
Marty/NNP Holah/NNP got/VBD the/DT All/DT Blacks/NNPS onslaught/NN under/IN way/NN with/IN his/PRP$ fifth-minute/JJ try/NN before/IN Rush/NN hit/VBD back/RP moments/NNS later./NN
But/CC New/NNP Zealand/NNP went/VBD ahead/RB once/RB more/JJR as/IN Gear/NNP made/VBD use/NN of/IN the/DT space/NN vacated/VBN by/IN a/DT temporarily/RB injured/VBN Chris/NNP Latham/NNP to/TO slide/VB in./NN
Ma'a/NNP Nonu/NNP then/RB found/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN through/IN the/DT Barbarians/NNPS defence/NN to/TO give/VB his/PRP$ side/NN a/DT 19-7/JJ half-time/NN lead./NN
The/DT hosts/NNS failed/VBD to/TO ignite/VB in/IN the/DT second/JJ half/NN and/CC the/DT moment/NN Gear/NNP scored/VBD his/PRP$ second/JJ just/RB after/IN the/DT interval/JJ there/EX was/VBD only/RB ever/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB one/CD winner./NN
Lo/NNP Cicero/NNP the/DT sole/JJ European/NN for/IN the/DT Barbarians/NNPS bundled/VBD over/RP for/IN a/DT try/NN to/TO briefly/VB curtail/VBP the/DT deficit./NN
But/CC the/DT match/NN was/VBD blighted/JJ by/IN controversy/NN moments/NNS later/RB when/WRB Justin/NNP Marshall/NNP was/VBD felled/VBN with/IN a/DT high/JJ tackle/NN by/IN Jimmy/NNP Cowan./NNP
Referee/NNP Andy/NNP Turner/NNP waved/VBD play/VB on/IN and/CC Casey/NNP Laulala/NNP coasted/VBD in/IN for/IN his/PRP$ side's/NNS fifth/JJ try./NN

After/IN the/DT match/NN Barbarians/NNPS coach/NN Bob/NNP Dwyer/NNP warned/VBD that/IN South/JJ African/JJ flanker/NN Schalk/NNP Burger/NNP needed/VBD a/DT proper/JJ off-season/NN break/NN to/TO maintain/VB his/PRP$ standards./NN
Burger/NNP 21/CD was/VBD recently/RB crowned/VBN player/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN by/IN both/DT his/PRP$ peers/NNS and/CC the/DT International/NNP Rugby/NNP Board/NNP but/CC has/VBZ struggled/VBN for/IN form/NN in/IN recent/JJ weeks./NN
