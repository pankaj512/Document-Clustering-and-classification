Immigration/NN to/TO be/VB election/NN issue/NN

Immigration/NNP and/CC asylum/NN have/VBP normally/RB been/VBN issues/NNS politicians/NNS from/IN the/DT big/JJ parties/NNS have/VBP tiptoed/VBN around/IN at/IN election/NN time./NN

But/CC no/DT longer./NN
Both/DT Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS have/VBP signalled/VBN their/PRP$ intention/NN of/IN making/VBG them/PRP central/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ election/NN campaigns./NN
They/PRP have/VBP been/VBN struck/VBN by/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN concern/NN amongst/IN voters/NNS about/IN the/DT issues/NNS with/IN internal/JJ surveys/NNS showing/VBG they/PRP have/VBP the/DT potential/NN to/TO swing/VB large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN votes./NN
That/DT was/VBD also/RB true/JJ at/IN the/DT last/JJ general/JJ election/NN and/CC the/DT issue/NN did/VBD briefly/NN become/VB a/DT campaigning/NN issue./NN
But/CC it/PRP sparked/VBD the/DT probably/RB predictable/JJ furore/NN with/IN claims/NNS politicians/NNS were/VBD either/CC stoking/VBG up/RP xenophobia/NN or/CC alternatively/RB running/VBG scared/VBN of/IN addressing/VBG the/DT problem./NN
But/CC this/DT time/NN around/IN it/PRP looks/VBZ set/VBN to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT core/NN battlegrounds/NNS with/IN both/DT the/DT big/JJ parties/NNS competing/VBG to/TO set/VB out/RP tough/JJ policies./NN

The/DT Tories/NNPS are/VBP already/RB committed/VBN to/TO imposing/VBG annual/JJ limits/NNS on/IN immigration/NN with/IN a/DT quota/NN for/IN asylum/NN seekers/NNS and/CC with/IN applications/NNS processed/VBN outside/IN the/DT UK./NNP
Labour/NNP has/VBZ already/RB branded/VBN the/DT proposal/NN unworkable/JJ but/CC party/NN strategists/NNS have/VBP seen/VBN the/DT Tories/NNPS seizing/VBG a/DT poll/NN advantage/NN over/IN the/DT issue./NN

Now/RB Home/NNP Secretary/NNP Charles/NNP Clarke/NNP has/VBZ come/VBN up/RP with/IN alternative/JJ proposals/NNS for/IN a/DT points/NNS system/NN to/TO ensure/VB only/JJ immigrants/NNS who/WP can/MD benefit/VB the/DT economy/NN will/MD be/VB granted/VBN entry/NN and/CC to/TO kick/VB out/RP more/JJR failed/VBD asylum/NN seekers./NN
That/DT has/VBZ been/VBN attacked/VBN by/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS as/RB too/RB little/JJ too/RB late/JJ and/CC for/IN failing/VBG to/TO tackle/VB the/DT key/JJ issue/NN of/IN the/DT numbers/NNS entering/VBG the/DT UK./NNP
The/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN drawn/VBN too/RB deeply/RB into/IN the/DT argument/NN but/CC have/VBP called/VBN for/IN a/DT Europe-wide/NNP policy/NN on/IN immigration./NN

But/CC while/IN all/PDT the/DT parties/NNS appear/VBP to/TO agree/VB the/DT time/NN has/VBZ come/VBN to/TO properly/RB debate/VB and/CC address/VB the/DT issue/NN there/EX are/VBP already/RB signs/NNS they/PRP will/MD run/VB into/IN precisely/RB the/DT same/JJ problems/NNS as/IN before./NN
Former/NNP union/NN leader/NN Sir/NNP Bill/NNP Morris/NNP has/VBZ already/RB accused/VBN both/DT the/DT big/JJ parties/NNS of/IN engaging/VBG in/IN a/DT "bidding/VBG war/NN about/IN who/WP can/MD be/VB nastiest/JJS to/TO asylum/VB seekers"./NN

"My/NN concern/NN is/VBZ that/DT whilst/VBP the/DT Labour/NNP Party/NNP and/CC the/DT Conservative/JJ Party/NNP will/MD take/VB a/DT constructive/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT debate/NN right-wing/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS picking/VBG up/RP on/IN statements/NNS like/IN `burden/NN to/TO Britain'/NNP will/MD exploit/VB this/DT and/CC create/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN fear/NN and/CC uncertainty"./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB that/DT concern/NN -/: and/CC the/DT possible/JJ suggestion/NN the/DT issue/NN is/VBZ playing/VBG to/TO the/DT far/RB right's/NNS racist/JJ agenda/NN -/: that/WDT will/MD provoke/VB strong/JJ reactions/NNS from/IN many/JJ concerned/VBN with/IN this/DT issue./NN
The/DT challenge/NN for/IN the/DT big/JJ parties/NNS is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB they/PRP can/MD engage/VB in/IN the/DT debate/NN during/IN the/DT cut/NN and/CC thrust/NN of/IN a/DT general/JJ election/NN while/IN also/RB avoiding/VBG that/DT trap./NN
