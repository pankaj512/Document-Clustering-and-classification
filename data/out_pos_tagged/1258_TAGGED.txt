Brown/NNP comes/VBZ out/RP shooting/VBG

Labour/NNP may/MD have/VB abolished/VBN hunting/NN -/: but/CC that/DT didn't/NN stop/VB Chancellor/NNP Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP using/VBG his/PRP$ Budget/NNP to/TO fire/VB both/DT barrels/NNS at/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT opposition/NN parties'/NN core/NN election/NN foxes./NN

Specifically/RB it/PRP saw/VBD him/PRP attempting/VBG to/TO slaughter/VB the/DT council/NN tax/NN as/IN an/DT election/NN issue/NN and/CC to/TO tear/VB limb/NN from/IN limb/VBP their/PRP$ wider/JJR policies/NNS for/IN pensioners/NNS and/CC families./NN
In/IN a/DT relatively/RB short/JJ speech/NN he/PRP kept/VBD the/DT best/JJS for/IN last/JJ and/CC was/VBD clearly/RB out/IN to/TO give/VB exactly/RP that/IN pre-election/JJ boost/NN everyone/NN had/VBD been/VBN predicting./NN
So/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT couple/NN with/IN children/NNS a/DT pensioner/NN a/DT patient/NN or/CC a/DT youngster/NN there/EX was/VBD something/NN pulled/VBD from/IN Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP red/JJ box/NN in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO persuade/VB you/PRP to/TO stick/VB with/IN or/CC switch/VB to/TO a/DT New/NNP Labour/NNP government./NN
Like/IN a/DT surgeon/NN he/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO target/VB his/PRP$ handouts/NNS with/IN absolute/JJ precision/NN onto/IN exactly/RB the/DT groups/NNS the/DT government/NN needs/VBZ to/TO appeal/VB to/TO in/IN the/DT election/NN campaign./NN

The/DT announcements/NNS brought/VBD great/JJ cheers/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ MPs/NNP who/WP are/VBP now/RB in/IN full-on/JJ election/NN mode/NN and/CC had/VBD been/VBN looking/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ man/NN to/TO give/VB them/PRP ammunition/VBP for/IN the/DT doorsteps./NN
They/PRP obviously/RB believed/VBD he/PRP had/VBD done/VBN that/IN for/IN them/PRP and/CC coincidentally/RB given/VBN his/PRP$ own/JJ image/NN as/IN a/DT prime/JJ minister-in-waiting/JJ another/DT little/JJ boost./NN

Labour/NNP MPs/NNP for/IN example/NN will/MD undoubtedly/RB now/RB engage/VB in/IN a/DT debate/NN over/IN exactly/RB how/WRB redistributive/JJ -/: a/DT lovely/JJ Old/NNP Labour/NNP word/NN -/: this/DT chancellor/NN really/RB is./NN
But/CC Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP is/VBZ never/RB going/VBG to/TO put/VB on/IN a/DT show/NN and/CC even/RB as/IN he/PRP was/VBD out/RP to/TO cast/VB himself/PRP as/IN the/DT man/NN who/WP will/MD win/VB Labour/NNP an/DT historic/JJ third/JJ term/NN his/PRP$ demeanour/NN remained/VBD quiet/JJ confident/JJ and/CC reassuring./NN
Prudence/NNP made/VBD an/DT appearance/NN albeit/IN towards/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN his/PRP$ address/NN as/IN he/PRP assured/VBD voters/NNS he/PRP would/MD do/VB nothing/NN to/TO mess/VB up/RP the/DT economic/JJ stability/NN he/PRP had/VBD brought/VBN to/TO Britain/NNP and/CC which/WDT he/PRP claimed/VBD would/MD be/VB thrown/VBN away/RB by/IN anyone/NN else./NN
According/VBG to/TO the/DT opposition/NN parties/NNS however/RB it/PRP is/VBZ all/DT one/CD big/JJ con/NN trick./NN

As/IN always/RB they/PRP accused/VBD him/PRP of/IN glossing/VBG over/IN the/DT facts/NNS of/IN the/DT "black/NN hole"/NN at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN his/PRP$ finances/NNS which/WDT they/PRP claim/VBP would/MD ensure/VB tax/NN increases/NNS after/IN the/DT election./NN
He/PRP did/VBD it/PRP most/RBS obviously/RB with/IN his/PRP$ increase/NN in/IN national/JJ insurance/NN contributions/NNS after/IN the/DT 2001/CD election/NN campaign/NN during/IN which/WDT he/PRP had/VBD pledged/VBN not/RB to/TO increase/VB income/NN tax./NN
As/IN Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP leader/NN Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP claimed/VBD for/IN most/JJS families/NNS the/DT distinction/NN between/IN income/NN tax/NN and/CC a/DT tax/NN on/IN income/NN is/VBZ meaningless./NN

Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD the/DT chancellor/NN was/VBD up/RP to/TO his/PRP$ old/JJ trick/NN of/IN deliberately/RB re-casting/JJ his/PRP$ forecasts/NNS to/TO give/VB the/DT illusion/NN that/DT everything/NN in/IN the/DT Treasury/NNP larder/NN is/VBZ as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN the/DT day/NN it/PRP was/VBD first/RB stored/VBD away/RB for/IN future/JJ use./NN
He/PRP branded/VBD it/PRP a/DT dodgy/NN "vote/NN now/RB pay/VB later"/NN budget/NN based/VBN on/IN dodgy/NN figures/NNS from/IN a/DT dodgy/NN government/NN that/WDT gave/VBD Britain/NNP the/DT dodgy/NN dossier./NN
Where/WRB the/DT chancellor/NN mostly/RB avoided/VBD direct/JJ electioneering/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP felt/VBD no/DT such/JJ constraint/NN with/IN attacks/NNS like/IN comparing/VBG Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP forecasts/NNS to/TO the/DT prime/JJ minister's/NNS forecasts/NNS on/IN Iraq's/NNP weapons/NNS of/IN mass/NN destruction./NN
As/IN ever/RB there/EX will/MD now/RB be/VB a/DT period/NN of/IN frantic/JJ activity/NN by/IN the/DT opposition/NN parties'/NN treasury/NN specialists/NNS as/IN they/PRP pore/VBP over/IN the/DT chancellor's/NNS red/JJ book/NN which/WDT sets/VBZ out/RP the/DT fine/JJ detail/NN of/IN his/PRP$ budget/NN in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO spot/VB the/DT flaws./NN
In/IN particular/JJ there/EX will/MD be/VB an/DT argument/NN over/IN precisely/RB whose/WP$ policies/NNS on/IN the/DT council/NN tax/NN will/MD offer/VB people/NNS the/DT best/JJS deal./NN
And/CC in/IN Labour/NNP circles/NNS there/RB will/MD undoubtedly/RB be/VB an/DT argument/NN over/IN just/RB how/WRB good/JJ a/DT prime/JJ minister/NN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD make/VB at/IN some/DT point/NN after/IN the/DT next/JJ election./NN
