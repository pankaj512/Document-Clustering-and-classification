Defiant/NNP Matt/NNP Williams/NNP says/VBZ he/PRP will/MD not/RB quit/VB as/IN Scotland/NNP coach/NN even/RB if/IN his/PRP$ side/NN slump/NN to/TO a/DT new/JJ low/NN with/IN defeat/NN by/IN Italy/NNP at/IN Murrayfield./NNP

That/DT would/MD leave/VB the/DT Scots/NNP as/IN favourites/NNS to/TO win/VB the/DT Wooden/JJ Spoon/NNP for/IN the/DT second/JJ year/NN running./NN
"I/NN have/VBP never/RB quit/VBN anything/NN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN apart/RB from/IN maybe/RB painting/VBG the/DT kitchen"/NN he/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP Sport./NNP
"The/NN support/NN we/PRP have/VBP been/VBN given/VBN from/IN Murrayfield/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ whole/JJ time/NN here/RB has/VBZ been/VBN 100%."/CD Williams/NNP has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO experience/VB an/DT RBS/NNP Six/CD Nations/NNPS victory/NN after/IN seven/CD attempts/NNS and/CC Scotland/NNP have/VBP lost/VBN 12/CD of/IN their/PRP$ 14/CD games/NNS under/IN his/PRP$ leadership./NN
But/CC he/PRP rejected/VBD the/DT comparison/NN made/VBN in/IN some/DT media/NNS sources/NNS with/IN Berti/NNP Vogts/NNP recently/RB sacked/VBD as/IN Scotland/NNP football/NN manager/NN after/IN a/DT poor/JJ run/NN of/IN results./NN

"That/NN is/VBZ not/RB beyond/IN the/DT realms/NNS of/IN possibility"/NN he/PRP admitted./VB
"There's/NN nothing/NN much/JJ between/IN the/DT teams/NNS so/IN we/PRP could/MD win/VB the/DT next/JJ three/CD games/NNS or/CC lose/VB them./NN
"But/NN I/PRP actually/RB really/RB enjoy/VB seeing/VBG how/WRB you/PRP cope/VBP with/IN such/JJ pressure/NN as/IN a/DT coach./NN
"It/NN helps/VBZ the/DT team/NN grow/NN and/CC helps/VBZ you/PRP grow/VBP as/IN a/DT coach./NN
"We/NN could/MD have/VB won/VBN in/IN Paris/NNP but/CC for/IN the/DT last/JJ five/CD minutes/NNS and/CC now/RB we/PRP have/VBP two/CD defeats/VBZ but/CC we/PRP were/VBD confident/JJ for/IN those/DT two/CD first/JJ games/NNS and/CC we/PRP are/VBP confident/JJ we/PRP can/MD beat/VB Italy/NNP too."/NN
