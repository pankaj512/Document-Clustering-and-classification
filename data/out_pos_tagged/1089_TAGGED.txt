The/DT EU/NNP has/VBZ opted/VBN to/TO adopt/VB qualified/VBN majority/NN voting/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN -/: previously/RB measures/NNS needed/VBD unanimous/JJ agreement/NN from/IN all/DT member/NN states./NN
Mr/NNP Blunkett/NNP told/VBD MPs/NNP the/DT UK/NNP would/MD still/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO reject/VB proposals/NNS on/IN immigration/NN it/PRP did/VBD not/RB agree/VB with./NN

He/PRP argued/VBD closer/JJR co-operation/JJ with/IN Europe/NNP over/IN asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN was/VBD crucial/JJ to/TO controlling/VBG the/DT flow/NN of/IN people/NNS into/IN the/DT UK./NNP
"If/NN we/PRP don't/VBP like/IN what/WP other/JJ EU/NNP countries/NNS do/VBP on/IN immigration/NN and/CC nationality/NN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO opt-in/JJ or/CC out/RB to/TO suit/VB the/DT British/JJ people"/NN he/PRP said./VB
The/DT home/NN secretary/NN was/VBD responding/VBG to/TO an/DT emergency/NN question/NN from/IN his/PRP$ Tory/NNP opposite/JJ number/NN Mr/NNP Davis./NNP
"The/NN government/NN is/VBZ employing/VBG the/DT politics/NNS of/IN confusion/NN -/: I/PRP think/VBP deliberately"/NN argued/VBD Mr/NNP Davis./NNP
"By/NN confusing/JJ the/DT country/NN it/PRP hopes/VBZ no/DT one/NN will/MD notice/VB the/DT disappearance/NN of/IN the/DT asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN veto."/NN On/IN Monday/NNP Tony/NNP Blair/NNP insisted/VBD closer/JJR co-operation/NN did/VBD not/RB mean/VB losing/VBG control/NN of/IN British/JJ borders./NN
He/PRP said/VBD an/DT enlarged/JJ 25-member/JJ EU/NNP needs/VBZ a/DT streamlined/JJ decision/NN making/VBG process./NN
Mr/NNP Davis/NNP said/VBD once/RB Britain/NNP had/VBD opted/VBN into/IN policies/NNS then/RB it/PRP could/MD not/RB opt/VB out/RP -/: leaving/VBG the/DT UK/NNP open/JJ to/TO unfavourable/JJ interpretations/NNS of/IN what/WP those/DT policies/NNS actually/RB meant./VBP

He/PRP accused/VBD the/DT government/NN of/IN being/VBG "pathetic"/NN when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD to/TO its/PRP$ efforts/NNS over/IN immigration/NN and/CC asylum/NN and/CC of/IN "surrendering"/NN on/IN the/DT issue./NN
And/CC he/PRP asked/VBD why/WRB the/DT government/NN was/VBD agreeing/VBG to/TO the/DT measure/NN on/IN asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN now/RB when/WRB the/DT whole/JJ issue/NN was/VBD part/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP constitution/NN which/WDT voters/NNS in/IN the/DT UK/NNP had/VBD been/VBN promised/VBN a/DT referendum/NN over./NN
Mr/NNP Blair/NNP told/VBD his/PRP$ monthly/JJ news/NN conference/NN Britain/NNP had/VBD the/DT "best/NN of/IN both/DT worlds"/NN and/CC would/MD keep/VB the/DT veto./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ no/DT question/NN of/IN Britain/NNP giving/VBG up/RP our/PRP$ veto/NN on/IN our/PRP$ border/NN controls"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"With/NN the/DT Treaty/NNP of/IN Amsterdam/NNP seven/CD years/NNS ago/RB we/PRP secured/VBD the/DT absolute/JJ right/NN to/TO opt/VB in/RP to/TO any/DT of/IN the/DT asylum/NN and/CC immigration/NN provisions/NNS that/IN we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO in/IN Europe."/NNP Mr/NNP Blunkett/NNP met/VBD his/PRP$ EU/NNP counterparts/NNS in/IN Luxembourg/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP to/TO consider/VB proposals/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN streamlining/VBG decision/NN making/VBG on/IN the/DT issue./NN

The/DT 25/CD member-states/NNS are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO scrap/VB the/DT requirement/NN for/IN unanimous/JJ agreement/NN on/IN immigration/NN policy/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT qualified/VBN majority/NN voting/NN (QMV)/NN system./NN
Under/IN this/DT scheme/NN larger/JJR states/NNS such/JJ as/IN Britain/NNP are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO have/VB more/JJR power/NN than/IN the/DT smaller/JJR EU/NNP states./NN
Britain/NNP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO retain/VB an/DT "opt-in"/JJ right/NN which/WDT will/MD allow/VB it/PRP to/TO ignore/VB any/DT measures/NNS it/PRP disagrees/VBZ with./NN
Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP spokesman/NN Mark/NNP Oaten/NNP called/VBD the/DT change/NN pragmatic/JJ and/CC argued/VBD it/PRP gave/VBD a/DT better/JJR chance/NN of/IN producing/VBG a/DT European/JJ asylum/NN solution./NN
"If/NN we/PRP don't/VBP work/NN together/RB it/PRP means/VBZ some/DT countries/NNS can/MD ignore/VB their/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN their/PRP$ neighbours"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Oaten./NNP
"The/NNP Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS have/VBP long/RB argued/VBN that/IN Britain/NNP should/MD be/VB a/DT safe/JJ haven/NN for/IN asylum/NN seekers/NNS but/CC it's/NNS right/NN that/IN we/PRP don't/VBP do/VBP this/DT in/IN isolation."/NN
