Ireland/NNP consigned/VBD England/NNP to/TO their/PRP$ third/JJ straight/JJ Six/CD Nations/NNPS defeat/NN with/IN a/DT stirring/VBG victory/NN at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road./NNP

A/DT second-half/JJ try/NN from/IN captain/NN Brian/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP and/CC 14/CD points/NNS from/IN Ronan/NNP O'Gara/NNP kept/VBD Ireland/NNP on/IN track/NN for/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP since/IN 1948./CD
England/NNP scored/VBD first/JJ through/IN Martin/NNP Corry/NNP but/CC had/VBD "tries"/NN from/IN Mark/NNP Cueto/NNP and/CC Josh/NNP Lewsey/NNP disallowed./JJ
Andy/NNP Robinson's/NNP men/NNS have/VBP now/RB lost/VBN nine/CD of/IN their/PRP$ last/JJ 14/CD matches/VBZ since/IN the/DT 2003/CD World/NNP Cup/NNP final./NN
The/DT defeat/NN also/RB heralded/VBD England's/NNP worst/JJS run/VB in/IN the/DT championship/NN since/IN 1987./CD
Ireland/NNP last/NN won/VBD the/DT title/NN then/RB the/DT Five/CD Nations/NNPS in/IN 1985/CD but/CC 20/CD years/NNS on/IN they/PRP share/VBP top/JJ spot/NN in/IN the/DT table/NN on/IN maximum/NN points/NNS with/IN Wales./NNP
And/CC Eddie/NNP O'Sullivan's/NNP side/NN banished/VBD the/DT ghosts/NNS of/IN 2003/CD when/WRB England/NNP were/VBD rampant/JJ 42-6/JJ victors/NNS in/IN claiming/VBG the/DT Grand/NNP Slam/NNP at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road./NNP
In/IN front/NN of/IN a/DT supercharged/JJ home/NN crowd/NN on/IN a/DT dry/JJ but/CC blustery/NN day/NN in/IN Dublin/NNP Ireland/NNP tore/VBD into/IN the/DT white-shirted/JJ visitors/NNS from/IN the/DT kick-off/JJ and/CC made/VBD their/PRP$ intentions/NNS clear/JJ when/WRB O'Gara/NNP landed/VBD a/DT fourth-minute/JJ drop-goal./JJ

England/NNP took/VBD their/PRP$ time/NN to/TO settle/VB but/CC their/PRP$ first/JJ real/JJ venture/NN into/IN Ireland's/NNP half/RB produced/VBD a/DT simple/JJ score/NN for/IN Corry./NNP
The/DT number/NN eight/CD picked/VBD up/RP the/DT ball/NN from/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN a/DT ruck/NN and/CC found/VBD an/DT absence/NN of/IN green/JJ jerseys/NNS between/IN himself/PRP and/CC the/DT Irish/JJ line/NN racing/VBG 25/CD yards/NNS to/TO touch/VB down./NN
England/NNP fly-half/JJ Charlie/NNP Hodgson/NNP nailed/VBD the/DT conversion/NN from/IN out/RP on/IN the/DT left/NN but/CC almost/RB immediately/RB O'Gara/NNP winning/VBG his/PRP$ 50th/JJ cap/NN answered/VBN with/IN two/CD penalties/NNS in/IN quick/JJ succession./NN
England/NNP were/VBD awarded/VBN a/DT penalty/NN of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ on/IN the/DT halfway/NN line/NN after/IN 20/CD minutes/NNS and/CC Hodgson/NNP the/DT villain/NN at/IN Twickenham/NNP coolly/RB bisected/VBD the/DT posts./NN
The/DT first/JJ quarter/NN was/VBD marked/VBN by/IN periods/NNS of/IN tactical/JJ kicking/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD Ireland/NNP who/WP were/VBD showing/VBG more/JJR willingness/NN to/TO spread/VB the/DT ball/NN wide/JJ to/TO their/PRP$ eager/JJ and/CC inventive/JJ backs./NN
A/DT series/NN of/IN probes/NNS led/VBN by/IN the/DT talismanic/JJ O'Driscoll/NNP back/RB from/IN hamstring/VBG injury/NN resulted/VBD in/IN a/DT penalty/NN but/CC Ireland/NNP chose/VBD to/TO kick/VB for/IN touch./NN

From/IN the/DT line-out/JJ the/DT ball/NN was/VBD recycled/JJ back/RB to/TO O'Gara/NNP who/WP stroked/VBD his/PRP$ second/JJ drop-goal/JJ this/DT time/NN off/RP the/DT right/JJ upright./NN
As/IN the/DT interval/JJ approached/VBN wing/NN Josh/NNP Lewsey/NNP was/VBD the/DT catalyst/NN for/IN England's/NNP most/JJS promising/JJ attack./NN
The/DT Wasps/NNP star/NN raced/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ touchline/NN and/CC Hodgson's/NNP cross-kick/JJ put/NN in/IN Mark/NNP Cueto/NNP for/IN an/DT apparent/JJ score/NN but/CC the/DT Sale/NNP wing/NN was/VBD ruled/VBN to/TO have/VB started/VBN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT kicker./NN
England/NNP began/VBD the/DT second/JJ half/NN well/RB and/CC had/VBD Ireland/NNP pinned/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ half./NN
But/CC another/DT English/JJ indiscretion/NN on/IN a/DT rare/JJ Irish/JJ break-out/NN awarded/VBD O'Gara/NNP a/DT kick/NN at/IN goal/NN which/WDT he/PRP missed./VB
England's/NNP pressure/NN continued/VBD and/CC a/DT wave/NN of/IN attacks/NNS saw/VBD centre/NN Jamie/NNP Noon/NN dragged/VBN down/RP yards/NNS from/IN the/DT line/NN before/IN Hodgson/NNP landed/VBD a/DT drop-goal./JJ

The/DT lead/NN was/VBD shortlived/VBN however./NN
Ireland/NNP raced/VBD upfield/NN deft/NN handling/VBG from/IN the/DT backs/NNS including/VBG a/DT clever/JJ dummy/NN from/IN Geordan/NNP Murphy/NNP on/IN Hodgson/NNP ending/VBG with/IN O'Driscoll/NNP going/VBG over/IN in/IN the/DT right/JJ corner/NN and/CC touching/VBG down/RP close/RB to/TO the/DT posts./NN
O'Gara/NNP missed/VBD a/DT penalty/NN which/WDT would/MD have/VB put/VBN Ireland/NNP nine/CD points/NNS clear/JJ and/CC the/DT home/NN crowd/NN breathed/VBD a/DT sigh/NN of/IN relief/NN when/WRB Hodgson's/NNP cross-kick/NN was/VBD fumbled/VBN by/IN lock/NN Ben/NNP Kay/NNP near/IN the/DT line./NN
Anticipation/NN of/IN a/DT home/NN win/NN sent/VBD the/DT noise/NN level/NN sky-high/JJ but/CC O'Gara/NNP missed/VBD another/DT chance/NN to/TO seal/VB the/DT game/NN with/IN a/DT wayward/JJ drop-goal/JJ attempt./NN
Inside/IN the/DT last/JJ 10/CD minutes/NNS England/NNP poured/VBD forward/RB spurred/VBN on/RP by/IN scrum-half/JJ Matt/NNP Dawson/NNP who/WP replaced/VBD Leicester's/NNP Harry/NNP Ellis./NNP
But/CC despite/IN one/CD near/IN miss/NN with/IN the/DT pack/NN over/IN the/DT line/NN -/: not/RB checked/VBN on/IN the/DT TV/NN replay/NN by/IN referee/NN Jonathan/NNP Kaplan/NNP -/: England/NNP were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO pull/VB off/RP a/DT face-saving/JJ win./NN
Ireland/NNP next/JJ face/NN France/NNP at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP in/IN two/CD weeks'/NN time/NN before/IN the/DT potential/JJ title/NN decider/NN against/IN Wales/NNP in/IN Cardiff./NNP
England/NNS are/VBP still/RB to/TO meet/VB Italy/NNP at/IN Twickenham/NNP in/IN what/WP is/VBZ now/RB a/DT wooden/JJ spoon/NN decider/NN and/CC Scotland./NNP
