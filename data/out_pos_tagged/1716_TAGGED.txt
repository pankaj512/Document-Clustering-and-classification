Celts/NNP savour/NN Grand/NNP Slam/NNP prospect/NN

The/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS has/VBZ heralded/VBN a/DT new/JJ order/NN in/IN northern/JJ hemisphere/NN rugby/NN this/DT year/NN and/CC Wales/NNP and/CC Ireland/NNP rather/RB than/IN traditional/JJ big/JJ guns/NNS France/NNP and/CC England/NNP face/NN a/DT potential/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP play-off/JJ in/IN three/CD weeks'/NN time./NN

But/CC before/IN that/DT game/NN in/IN Cardiff/NNP Wales/NNP must/MD get/VB past/JJ Scotland/NNP at/IN Murrayfield/NNP while/IN Ireland/NNP face/NN the/DT not/RB insignificant/JJ task/NN of/IN a/DT home/NN fixture/NN with/IN the/DT mercurial/JJ French./NNP
No-one/NNP knows/VBZ what/WP mood/NN France/NNP will/MD be/VB in/IN at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP on/IN 12/CD March/NNP -/: sublime/JJ as/IN in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN against/IN Wales/NNP or/CC ridiculous/JJ like/IN in/IN the/DT same/JJ period/NN against/IN England/NNP at/IN Twickenham./NNP
But/CC how/WRB the/DT mighty/JJ have/VBP fallen./NN
England/NNP sat/VBD on/IN rugby's/NNS summit/NN 15/CD months/NNS ago/RB as/IN world/NN champions/NNS and/CC 2003/CD Grand/NNP Slam/NNP winners./NN
But/CC they/PRP have/VBP lost/VBN nine/CD of/IN their/PRP$ 14/CD matches/VBZ since/IN that/DT heady/JJ night/NN in/IN Sydney./NNP
And/CC they/PRP face/VBP the/DT ignominy/NN of/IN what/WP could/MD amount/VB to/TO a/DT Wooden/JJ Spoon/NNP play-off/JJ against/IN Italy/NNP in/IN a/DT fortnight./NN

England/NNS are/VBP enduring/VBG their/PRP$ worst/JJS run/VB in/IN the/DT championship/NN since/IN captain/NN Richard/NNP Hill/NNP was/VBD dumped/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN Mike/NNP Harrison/NNP after/IN three/CD straight/JJ losses/NNS in/IN 1987./CD
Coach/VB Andy/NNP Robinson/NNP who/WP took/VBD over/RP from/IN the/DT successful/JJ Sir/NNP Clive/NNP Woodward/NNP in/IN September/NNP has/VBZ lost/VBN a/DT phalanx/NN of/IN World/NNP Cup/NNP stars./NN
And/CC he/PRP is/VBZ enduring/VBG the/DT toughest/JJS of/IN teething/VBG problems/NNS in/IN bedding/NN down/RP his/PRP$ own/JJ style/NN with/IN a/DT new/JJ team./NN
The/DT same/JJ year/NN that/IN England/NNP ruled/VBD the/DT roost/NN a/DT woeful/JJ Wales/NNP lost/VBD all/DT five/CD matches/VBZ in/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations./NNP
And/CC they/PRP won/VBD only/RB two/CD games/NNS against/IN Scotland/NNP and/CC Italy/NNP in/IN 2004./CD
Wales'/NNP most/RBS recent/JJ championship/NN title/NN was/VBD in/IN 1994/CD and/CC their/PRP$ last/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP success/NN came/VBD in/IN 1978/CD in/IN the/DT era/NN of/IN Gareth/NNP Edwards/NNP Phil/NNP Bennett/NNP JPR/NNP Williams/NNP et/CC al./NN

But/CC Welsh/NNP rugby/NN fans/NNS remain/VBP on/IN permanent/JJ tenterhooks/NNS for/IN the/DT blossoming/NN of/IN a/DT new/JJ golden/JJ age./NN
After/IN several/JJ false/JJ dawns/VBZ coach/NN Mike/NNP Ruddock/NNP may/MD have/VB come/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT team/NN and/CC philosophy/NN to/TO match/VB expectations./NN
The/DT fresh/JJ verve/NN is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN skipper/NN Gareth/NNP Thomas/NNP now/RB out/IN with/IN a/DT broken/VBN thumb/NN accurate/JJ kicking/NN from/IN either/CC fly-half/JJ Stephen/NNP Jones/NNP or/CC centre/NN Gavin/NNP Henson/NNP a/DT rampant/JJ Martyn/NNP Williams/NNP leading/VBG the/DT way/NN up/RP front/NN and/CC exciting/JJ runners/NNS in/IN the/DT guise/NN of/IN Henson/NNP and/CC Shane/NNP Williams./NNP
Ireland/NNP coach/NN Eddie/NNP O'Sullivan/NNP and/CC captain/NN Brian/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP have/VBP got/VBN their/PRP$ side/NN buzzing/VBG too/RB and/CC they/PRP are/VBP close/RB to/TO shedding/VBG the/DT "nearly-men"/JJ tag/NN that/WDT has/VBZ dogged/VBN them/PRP for/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years./NN
The/DT men/NNS from/IN the/DT Emerald/NNP Isle/NNP have/VBP been/VBN Six/CD Nations/NNPS runners-up/NNS for/IN the/DT past/JJ two/CD years/NNS to/TO France/NNP and/CC England./NNP

But/CC they/PRP have/VBP not/RB won/VBN the/DT title/NN since/IN 1985/CD and/CC last/JJ clinched/VBN a/DT Grand/NNP Slam/NNP in/IN 1948./CD
As/IN for/IN Scotland/NNP they/PRP have/VBP struggled/VBN this/DT decade/NN and/CC the/DT 2004/CD Wooden/JJ Spoon/NNP "winners"/NN have/VBP not/RB been/VBN in/IN the/DT top/JJ two/CD since/IN they/PRP lifted/VBD the/DT title/NN in/IN 1999./CD
Italy/NNP continue/VB the/DT elusive/JJ search/NN for/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ Six/CD Nations/NNPS away/RB win/VB and/CC can/MD still/RB only/RB account/VBP for/IN the/DT scalps/NNS of/IN Scotland/NNP (twice)/NN and/CC Wales/NNP since/IN joining/VBG the/DT elite/NN in/IN 2000./CD
Coach/VB John/NNP Kirwan/NNP is/VBZ a/DT passionate/JJ and/CC dedicated/JJ believer/NN in/IN the/DT Azzurri/NNP but/CC is/VBZ lacking/VBG in/IN raw/JJ materials./NN
And/CC so/RB to/TO France./NNP
Brilliant/JJ one/CD minute/NN inept/JJ the/DT next./NN
But/CC the/DT reigning/VBG champions/NNS could/MD quite/RB easily/RB turn/VB on/IN the/DT style/NN in/IN Dublin/NNP and/CC end/VB up/RP winning/VBG the/DT title/NN through/IN the/DT back/JJ door./NN
Ireland/NNP though/IN have/VBP won/VBN three/CD times/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ last/JJ five/CD meetings./NN
Welsh/NN romantics/NNS would/MD probably/RB prefer/VB a/DT glorious/JJ victory/NN in/IN the/DT Celtic/NNP showdown/NN to/TO crown/VB their/PRP$ Grand/NNP Slam./NNP
But/CC given/VBN that/IN Ireland/NNP have/VBP beaten/VBN Wales/NNP in/IN four/CD of/IN their/PRP$ last/JJ five/CD meetings/NNS the/DT Welsh/NNP legions/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB behind/IN Les/NNP Bleus/NNP on/IN 12/CD March./NNP
