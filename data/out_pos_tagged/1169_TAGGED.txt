The/DT "best/JJ person/NN for/IN the/DT job"/NN should/MD be/VB appointed/VBN lord/NN chancellor/NN and/CC not/RB necessarily/RB a/DT lawyer/NN or/CC MP/NNP the/DT courts/NNS minister/NN has/VBZ told/VBN MPs./NNP

Under/IN reforms/NNS the/DT post/NN of/IN lord/NN chancellor/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB stripped/VBN of/IN its/PRP$ judicial/JJ functions./NN
"The/NN lord/NN chancellor...no/NN more/JJR needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT lawyer/NN than/IN the/DT Secretary/NNP of/IN Health/NNP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT doctor"/NN said/VBD courts/NNS minister/NN Christopher/NNP Leslie./NNP
The/DT Constitutional/NNP Reform/NNP Bill/NNP was/VBD entering/VBG its/PRP$ second/JJ reading/NN on/IN Monday./NNP
Mr/NNP Leslie/NNP said/VBD "The/NN prime/JJ minister/NN should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO appoint/VB the/DT best/JJS person/NN for/IN the/DT job/NN whether/IN they/PRP sit/VBP in/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords/NNPS or/CC the/DT House/NNP of/IN Commons."/NNP Under/IN the/DT reforms/NNS the/DT Law/NNP Lords/NNPS will/MD also/RB be/VB replaced/VBN as/IN the/DT UK's/NNP highest/JJS legal/JJ authority/NN by/IN a/DT Supreme/NNP Court/NNP and/CC judges/NNS will/MD be/VB appointed/VBN by/IN an/DT independent/JJ panel/NN rather/RB than/IN ministers./NN

The/DT peers/VBZ voted/VBN by/IN 229/CD to/TO 206/CD to/TO say/VB in/IN law/NN that/DT lord/NN chancellors/NNS must/MD also/RB be/VB peers./NN
The/DT debate/NN was/VBD carried/VBN over/IN from/IN the/DT last/JJ Parliamentary/JJ session/NN but/CC with/IN an/DT impending/JJ general/JJ election/NN time/NN is/VBZ crucial/JJ for/IN the/DT government/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT Bill/NNP passed./NN
Mr/NNP Leslie/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD irrelevant/JJ whether/IN the/DT post/NN was/VBD called/VBN Secretary/NNP of/IN State/NNP for/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNP or/CC Lord/NNP Chancellor./NNP

"It/NN is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB appropriate/JJ for/IN a/DT government/NN minister/NN to/TO have/VB such/JJ unfettered/JJ discretion/NN in/IN the/DT appointment/NN of/IN judges."/NN

Shadow/NNP attorney/NN general/NN Dominic/NNP Grieve/NNP criticised/VBD the/DT government/NN on/IN its/PRP$ plans/NNS to/TO change/VB what/WP he/PRP said/VBD was/VBD an/DT "exceptional/JJ institution"/NN providing/VBG a/DT "champion/NN of/IN the/DT independence/NN of/IN the/DT judiciary"./NN
The/DT government/NN had/VBD initially/RB proposed/VBN to/TO take/VB this/DT institution/NN and/CC "smash/NN it/PRP to/TO pieces"/VB Mr/NNP Grieve/NNP said./NN
Convention/NNP should/MD be/VB "nurtured/VBN and/CC celebrated"/NN but/CC the/DT government/NN distrusted/JJ and/CC disliked/JJ it/PRP instead./NN
He/PRP warned/VBD that/IN unless/IN ministers/NNS backed/VBN down/RP over/IN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN remaining/VBG a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords/NNPS the/DT government/NN would/MD have/VB "great/NN difficulty"/NN in/IN getting/VBG the/DT Bill/NNP through/IN Parliament./NNP
Former/NNP Cabinet/NNP minister/NN Douglas/NNP Hogg/NNP whose/WP$ father/NN and/CC grandfather/NN served/VBD as/IN lord/NN chancellor/NN said/VBD the/DT Bill/NNP was/VBD "largely/RB unnecessary/JJ bureaucratic/JJ and/CC expensive"./NN
