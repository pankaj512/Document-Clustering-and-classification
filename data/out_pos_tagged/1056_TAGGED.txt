A/DT senior/JJ barrister/NN who/WP has/VBZ resigned/VBN in/IN protest/NN over/IN the/DT government's/NNS anti-terror/JJ laws/NNS says/VBZ the/DT current/JJ system/NN is/VBZ giving/VBG Britain/NNP a/DT bad/JJ name./NN

Ian/NNP MacDonald/NNP QC/NNP quit/VBD when/WRB the/DT government/NN failed/VBD to/TO recognise/VB a/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords/NNPS ruling/NN that/IN detaining/VBG terror/NN suspects/VBZ indefinitely/RB is/VBZ unlawful./NN
He/PRP was/VBD part/NN of/IN a/DT 19-strong/JJ panel/NN who/WP have/VBP special/JJ security/NN clearance/NN to/TO act/VB for/IN suspected/VBN terrorists./NN
Five/CD more/JJR barristers/NNS are/VBP now/RB reported/VBN to/TO be/VB threatening/VBG to/TO resign./VB

Mr/NNP MacDonald/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP News/NNP "The/NN reason/NN why/WRB I/PRP am/VBP resigning/VBG is/VBZ because/IN I/PRP fundamentally/RB disagree/VBP with/IN locking/VBG people/NNS up/RP without/IN any/DT trial/NN for/IN an/DT indefinite/JJ period/NN on/IN reasonable/JJ suspicion./NN
"The/NN current/JJ legal/JJ system/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB having/VBG a/DT very/RB adverse/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT Muslim/NNP community/NN in/IN Britain/NNP and/CC the/DT whole/JJ Asian/JJ community./NN
"I/NN think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ giving/VBG Britain/NNP a/DT bad/JJ name/NN internationally"./JJ

Under/IN the/DT Anti-Terrorism/NNP Crime/NN and/CC Security/NNP Act/NNP introduced/VBD by/IN the/DT government/NN in/IN 2001/CD in/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT 11/CD September/NNP attacks/NNS foreign/JJ nationals/NNS suspected/VBN of/IN involvement/NN in/IN terrorism/NN who/WP cannot/VBP be/VB deported/VBN can/MD be/VB held/VBN indefinitely/RB without/IN trial./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP MacDonald/NNP believes/VBZ that/IN detainees/NNS currently/RB being/VBG held/VBN should/MD be/VB entitled/VBN to/TO a/DT trial/NN by/IN jury./NN
"My/NN own/JJ view/NN is/VBZ we/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT full/JJ return/NN to/TO trial/NN by/IN jury/NN a/DT proper/JJ criminal/JJ trial/NN with/IN proper/JJ accusations./NN
"As/NN far/RB as/IN I'm/NNP concerned/VBD the/DT government/NN have/VBP to/TO start/VB all/RB over/RB again/RB and/CC rethink/VB their/PRP$ whole/JJ strategy/NN for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN this."/NN he/PRP added./VB

The/DT Attorney/NNP General/NNP Lord/NNP Goldsmith/NNP will/MD receive/VB a/DT letter/NN of/IN resignation/NN from/IN Mr/NNP MacDonald/NNP on/IN Monday./NNP
According/VBG to/TO the/DT Independent/NNP his/PRP$ resignation/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO be/VB followed/VBN by/IN those/DT of/IN five/CD other/JJ barristers/NNS -/: Nicholas/NNP Blake/NNP QC/NNP Andrew/NNP Nicol/NNP QC/NNP Manjit/NNP Singh/NNP Gill/NNP QC/NNP Rick/NNP Scannell/NNP and/CC Tom/NNP de/NNP la/NNP Mare./NNP
They/PRP are/VBP all/DT believed/VBN to/TO be/VB carefully/RB considering/VBG their/PRP$ positions/NNS on/IN the/DT panel/NN of/IN Special/JJ Advocates/NNS who/WP represent/VBP detainees/NNS before/IN the/DT Special/JJ Immigration/NNP Appeals/NNPS Commission/NNP (SIAC)/NN -/: a/DT secure/NN court/NN without/IN a/DT jury/NN which/WDT tries/VBZ terror/NN suspects./NN
Mr/NNP MacDonald/NNP said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD "no/NN idea"/NN whether/IN further/JJ resignations/NNS would/MD follow./VB
But/CC Barry/NNP Hugill/NNP a/DT spokesman/NN for/IN the/DT campaign/NN group/NN Liberty/NNP told/VBD Radio/NNP 4's/CD Today/NN programme/NN that/IN more/JJR lawyers/NNS may/MD go./VB
"I/NN can/MD assure/VB that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT distinct/JJ possibilty/NN that/IN more/JJR lawyers/NNS may/MD be/VB resigning"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"They/NN are/VBP now/RB in/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB everything/NN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN trained/VBN to/TO believe/VB in/IN the/DT right/NN to/TO trial/NN by/IN jury/NN has/VBZ been/VBN abandoned/VBN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ what/WP gives/VBZ some/DT of/IN them/PRP sleepless/NNS nights."/NN

Helena/NNP Kennedy/NNP a/DT Labour/NNP peer/NN and/CC a/DT human/JJ rights/NNS lawyer/NN said/VBD the/DT Special/JJ Advocates'/NNP main/JJ concern/NN was/VBD that/IN once/IN they/PRP had/VBD seen/VBN any/DT special/JJ intelligence/NN they/PRP were/VBD not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO speak/VB to/TO the/DT detainees./NN
"When/NN this/DT whole/JJ procedure/NN was/VBD being/VBG considered/VBN immediately/RB after/IN 11/CD September/NNP there/EX was/VBD a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN argument/NN particularly/RB in/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords/NNPS about/IN whether/IN there/EX really/RB was/VBD a/DT process/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB considered/VBN a/DT judicial/JJ review"/NN she/PRP said./VBP
"Without/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP having/VBG detention/NN with/IN no/DT habeus/NN corpus/JJ and/CC really/RB a/DT blot/NN as/IN Ian/NNP McDonald/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD on/IN our/PRP$ legal/JJ landscape/NN something/NN really/RB quite/RB shocking/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/TO the/DT rule/NN of/IN the/DT law."/NN
