Running/VBG around/IN the/DT Olympics/NNPS

It/PRP was/VBD back/RB to/TO official/VB duties/NNS last/JJ week/NN in/IN my/PRP$ role/NN as/IN an/DT ambassador/NN to/TO London's/NNP 2012/CD Olympic/NNP bid./NN
But/CC I/PRP still/RB managed/VBD to/TO do/VB all/DT my/PRP$ marathon/NN training./NN

All/PDT the/DT sporting/VBG people/NNS on/IN the/DT capital's/NNS bid/NN team/NN think/VBP I'm/NNP mad/JJ to/TO be/VB taking/VBG part/NN in/IN the/DT London/NNP Marathon./NNP
The/DT bid/NN chairman/NN Lord/NNP Coe/NNP admitted/VBD he/PRP would/MD never/RB dream/VB of/IN running/VBG a/DT marathon/NN even/RB though/IN he/PRP was/VBD an/DT Olympic/NNP middle-distance/JJ runner./NN

Kelly/NNP Holmes/NNP former/JJ hurdler/NN Alan/NNP Pascoe/NNP and/CC former/JJ sprinter/NN Frankie/NNP Fredericks/NNP -/: who/WP is/VBZ now/RB an/DT IOC/NNP member/NN -/: all/DT wanted/VBD to/TO know/VB why/WRB anyone/NN would/MD want/VB to/TO run/VB that/DT far./NN
You'd/NNS have/VBP thought/VBN all/PDT these/DT athletes/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN running/VBG for/IN most/JJS of/IN their/PRP$ lives/NNS wouldn't/NN think/VBP it/PRP would/MD be/VB that/DT bad./NN
But/CC the/DT only/JJ person/NN who/WP was/VBD positive/JJ about/IN my/PRP$ intentions/NNS was/VBD Tanni/NNP Grey/NNP Thompson/NNP who/WP has/VBZ won/VBN the/DT London/NNP Marathon/NNP wheelchair/NN race/NN six/CD times./NN
Even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB busy/JJ week/NN entertaining/JJ the/DT International/NNP Olympic/NNP Committee's/NNP (IOC)/NN Evaluation/NN Commission/NNP I/PRP actually/RB found/VBD my/PRP$ running/NN schedule/NN easier/JJR to/TO follow./VB
When/WRB I'm/NNP at/IN home/NN I/PRP get/VBP distracted/VBN by/IN all/DT sorts/NNS of/IN things/NNS but/CC for/IN the/DT five/CD days/NNS I/PRP was/VBD in/IN London/NNP I/PRP was/VBD in/IN a/DT pressurised/VBN situation/NN but/CC I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP easy/JJ to/TO relax/VB by/IN running./NN

On/IN Wednesday/NNP the/DT presentations/NNS to/TO the/DT IOC/NNP team/NN did/VBD not/RB finish/VB until/IN the/DT early/JJ evening/NN so/IN I/PRP just/RB managed/VBD to/TO squeeze/VB in/IN a/DT 45-minute/JJ run./NN
We/PRP had/VBD an/DT early/JJ start/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP because/IN we/PRP had/VBD to/TO visit/VB all/PDT the/DT Olympic/NNP sites/NNS around/IN London/NNP that/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB shattering/VBG but/CC when/WRB we/PRP got/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT hotel/NN I/PRP got/VBD back/RB on/IN the/DT treadmill./NN
On/IN Friday/NNP evening/NN I/PRP went/VBD along/IN to/TO the/DT special/JJ dinner/NN at/IN Buckingham/NNP Palace/NNP which/WDT was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ occasion./NN
I/PRP never/RB feel/VBP guilty/JJ about/IN eating/VBG especially/RB when/WRB I'm/NNP exercising./NN
And/CC because/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT rest/NN day/NN I/PRP didn't/VBP have/VBP to/TO feel/VB bad/JJ about/IN missing/VBG my/PRP$ training/NN either./NN
Anyway/RB I/PRP managed/VBD to/TO do/VB another/DT quick/JJ run/NN on/IN Saturday/NNP ahead/RB of/IN the/DT final/JJ IOC/NNP presentations/NNS before/IN heading/VBG home/NN for/IN my/PRP$ daughter's/NNS birthday./NN

When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD in/IN London/NNP I/PRP did/VBD all/DT of/IN my/PRP$ runs/NNS on/IN the/DT treadmill/NN which/WDT isn't/NN the/DT same/JJ as/IN exercising/VBG outdoors./NN
One/CD of/IN the/DT IOC's/NNP technical/JJ staff/NN from/IN Australia/NNP ran/VBD alongside/IN me/PRP one/CD day./NN
We/PRP talked/VBD about/IN the/DT Sydney/NNP Olympics/NNPS and/CC that/WDT made/VBN the/DT time/NN go/VBP past/JJ more/JJR quickly./NN
I/PRP do/VBP find/VB it/PRP quite/RB comfortable/JJ running/NN in/IN the/DT gym/NN because/IN there/EX is/VBZ more/JJR cushioning./NN
But/CC when/WRB you're/NN gearing/VBG up/IN to/TO running/VBG on/IN the/DT road/NN you/PRP need/VBP your/PRP$ body/NN to/TO get/VB used/VBN to/TO that/DT jarring/JJ feeling/NN when/WRB your/PRP$ feet/NNS hit/VBD the/DT pavement./NN
It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ to/TO get/VB out/RP on/IN the/DT road/NN for/IN my/PRP$ long/JJ run/NN on/IN Sunday./NNP
After/IN the/DT week/NN I'd/NNP had/VBD I/PRP was/VBN a/DT bit/NN concerned/VBD I/PRP wouldn't/VBP be/VB able/JJ to/TO complete/VB it./NN
But/CC I/PRP coped/VBD with/IN it/PRP very/RB well/RB and/CC even/RB though/IN it/PRP was/VBD bitterly/RB cold/JJ I/PRP put/VBD in/IN 15-and-a-half/JJ miles/NNS -/: only/RB another/DT 11/CD to/TO go/VB then./NN
