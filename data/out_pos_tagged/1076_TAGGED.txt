Falconer/NN rebuts/NNS 'charade'/NN claims/NNS

Concessions/NNS on/IN a/DT bill/NN which/WDT critics/NNS claim/VBP would/MD allow/VB euthanasia/NN "through/NN the/DT back/JJ door"/NN were/VBD not/RB a/DT political/JJ ploy/NN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN has/VBZ said./NN

Ministers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN accused/VBN of/IN panic/NN in/IN offering/VBG last/JJ minute/NN changes/NNS to/TO the/DT Mental/NNP Capacity/NN Bill/NNP amid/IN chaotic/JJ scenes/NNS in/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS on/IN Tuesday./NNP
Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD fair/JJ to/TO criticise/VB the/DT late/JJ timing/NN of/IN the/DT offer./NN
He/PRP said/VBD the/DT changes/NNS provided/VBD a/DT solution/NN to/TO a/DT very/RB difficult/JJ issue/NN but/CC some/DT MPs/NNP argue/VBP the/DT situation/NN is/VBZ still/RB unclear./NN

The/DT bill/NN allows/VBZ people/NNS to/TO give/VB somebody/NN the/DT power/NN of/IN attorney/NN to/TO make/VB decisions/NNS on/IN their/PRP$ behalf/NN if/IN they/PRP become/VBP too/RB ill/JJ to/TO decide/VB for/IN themselves./NN
Ministers/NNS insist/VBP the/DT plans/NNS would/MD not/RB change/VB laws/NNS on/IN euthanasia/NN and/CC would/MD improve/VB safeguards./NN
Critics/NNS fear/VBP it/PRP could/MD allow/VB "killing/VBG by/IN omission"/NN through/IN withdrawing/VBG treatment/NN including/VBG food/NN and/CC fluids./NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP said/VBD he/PRP would/MD do/VB everything/NN he/PRP could/MD to/TO meet/VB concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT bill./NN
But/CC changes/NNS to/TO the/DT bill/NN must/MD not/RB overturn/VB the/DT law/NN set/VBN when/WRB a/DT court/NN ruled/VBD that/IN doctors/NNS could/MD withdraw/VB artificial/JJ feeding/NN and/CC hydration/NN from/IN Hillsborough/NNP coma/NN victim/NN Tony/NNP Bland./NNP
"It/NN is/VBZ important/JJ we/PRP don't/VBP end/NN up/RP in/IN the/DT situation/NN where/WRB doctors/NNS and/CC consultants/NNS are/VBP confused/JJ about/IN the/DT law/NN and/CC may/MD lay/VB themselves/PRP open/JJ to/TO prosecution/VB in/IN circumstances/NNS where/WRB no/DT sensible/JJ person/NN would/MD want/VB that/IN to/TO happen"/VB he/PRP said./VB

On/IN Tuesday/NNP the/DT government/NN saw/VBD off/RP a/DT backbench/JJ attempt/NN to/TO force/VB changes/NNS to/TO the/DT bill/NN by/IN 297/CD votes/NNS to/TO 203/CD despite/IN rebellion/NN by/IN 34/CD Labour/NNP MPs./NNP
The/DT revolt/NN was/VBD also/RB reduced/VBN by/IN news/NN that/IN Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP had/VBD promised/VBN the/DT Catholic/NNP archbishop/NN of/IN Cardiff/NNP to/TO strengthen/VB safeguards/NNS in/IN the/DT bill./NN
But/CC that/IN only/RB came/VBD after/IN MPs/NNP bombarded/VBD Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNP Minister/NNP David/NNP Lammy/NNP with/IN a/DT barrage/NN of/IN requests/NNS for/IN him/PRP to/TO read/VB the/DT letter/NN as/IN they/PRP complained/VBD they/PRP had/VBD been/VBN left/VBN in/IN the/DT dark./NN
Eventually/RB he/PRP was/VBD hurriedly/RB handed/VBN the/DT letter/NN to/TO read/VB out/RP five/CD minutes/NNS before/IN the/DT crunch/NN votes/NNS prompting/VBG claims/NNS of/IN a/DT shambles./NN
The/DT deputy/NN speaker/NN later/RB said/VBD the/DT debate/NN had/VBD not/RB been/VBN handled/VBN as/IN it/PRP should/MD have/VB been./NN

Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP says/VBZ there/EX will/MD be/VB amendments/NNS when/WRB the/DT bill/NN goes/VBZ to/TO the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords./NNP
He/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP News/NNP "We/NN have/VBP given/VBN a/DT commitment/NN to/TO put/VB into/IN the/DT bill/NN a/DT clause/NN that/WDT says/VBZ that/IN nothing/NN in/IN the/DT bill/NN authorises/VBZ any/DT act/NN where/WRB the/DT motive/NN of/IN the/DT person/NN authorising/VBG the/DT decision/NN is/VBZ to/TO end/VB life./NN
"The/NN motive/NN has/VBZ got/VBD to/TO be/VB to/TO end/VB suffering."/NN He/PRP denied/VBD the/DT concessions/NNS were/VBD a/DT "political/JJ manoeuvre"/NN forced/VBN by/IN panic/NN about/IN the/DT rebellion./NN
It/PRP was/VBD inevitable/JJ that/IN minds/NNS became/VBD more/RBR focused/JJ as/IN the/DT bill/NN went/VBD through/RB Parliament/NNP but/CC the/DT result/NN was/VBD a/DT "sensible/JJ solution"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"I/NN don't/NN think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ something/NN to/TO be/VB embarrassed/JJ about./NN
These/DT issues/NNS are/VBP not/RB easy/JJ to/TO deal/VB with"/NN he/PRP went/VBD on./NN
BBC/NNP political/JJ editor/NN Andrew/NNP Marr/NNP said/VBD Mr/NNP Lammy/NNP was/VBD "waste/NN deep/JJ in/IN quicksand/NN and/CC sinking/VBG fast"/NN after/IN his/PRP$ performance./NN
But/CC Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP praised/VBD his/PRP$ minister/NN for/IN an/DT "excellent/NN job"./NN
Former/NNP Conservative/JJ leader/NN Iain/NNP Duncan/NNP Smith/NNP one/CD of/IN the/DT chief/JJ critics/NNS of/IN the/DT plans/NNS condemned/VBD the/DT debate/NN as/IN a/DT "charade"/NN and/CC complained/VBD the/DT promises/NNS of/IN changes/NNS to/TO the/DT bill/NN were/VBD vague./NN
