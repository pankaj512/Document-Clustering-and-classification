Billions/NNS of/IN farmers'/NN livelihoods/NNS are/VBP at/IN risk/NN from/IN falling/VBG commodity/NN prices/NNS and/CC protectionism/VB the/DT UN's/NNP Food/NNP &/CC Agriculture/NNP Organisation/NNP has/VBZ warned./NN

Trade/NN barriers/NNS and/CC subsidies/NNS "severely"/NN distort/VBP the/DT market/NN the/DT FAO/NNP report/NN on/IN the/DT "State/NN of/IN Agricultural/NNP Commodity/NNP Markets/NNPS 2004"/CD said./NN
As/IN a/DT result/NN the/DT 2.5/CD billion/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT developing/VBG world/NN who/WP rely/VBP on/IN farming/VBG face/NN food/NN insecurity./NN
The/DT most/RBS endangered/VBD are/VBP those/DT who/WP live/VBP in/IN the/DT least-developed/JJ countries./NN
The/DT FAO/NNP report/NN said/VBD that/DT support/NN for/IN farmers/NNS in/IN industrialised/VBN nations/NNS was/VBD equivalent/JJ to/TO 30/CD times/NNS the/DT amount/NN provided/VBN as/IN aid/NN for/IN agricultural/JJ development/NN in/IN poor/JJ countries./NN

The/DT FAO/NNP has/VBZ urged/VBN the/DT World/NNP Trade/NNP Organisation/NNP to/TO swiftly/RB conclude/VB negotiations/NNS to/TO liberalise/VB trade/NN easing/VBG developing/VBG countries'/NN access/NN to/TO the/DT world/NN market./NN

The/DT market/NN situation/NN has/VBZ divided/VBN developing/VBG nations/NNS in/IN two/CD groups/NNS the/DT FAO/NNP said./NN
