Defection/NN timed/VBN to/TO hit/VB tax/NN pledge/NN

With/IN impeccable/JJ and/CC precisely-calculated/JJ timing/NN Tory/NNP defector/NN Robert/NNP Jackson/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ new/JJ Labour/NNP bosses/NNS have/VBP attempted/VBN to/TO overshadow/VB Michael/NNP Howard's/NNP latest/JJS announcement/NN on/IN taxation/NN and/CC spending./NN

With/IN just/RB about/IN everyone/NN in/IN Westminster/NNP now/RB working/VBG towards/IN a/DT May/NNP general/JJ election/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP is/VBZ eager/JJ to/TO map/VB out/RP some/DT clear/JJ and/CC distinctive/JJ policies/NNS aimed/VBN at/IN finally/RB shifting/VBG the/DT Tories'/NNP resolutely/RB depressing/VBG poll/NN showings./NN
The/DT big/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ £35bn/CD savings/NNS on/IN waste/NN and/CC bureaucracy/NN which/WDT Mr/NNP Howard/NNP has/VBZ pledged/VBN to/TO plough/VB back/RB into/IN public/JJ services/NNS and/CC tax/NN cuts./NN
And/CC it/PRP was/VBD virtually/RB certain/JJ his/PRP$ pledge/NN on/IN tax/NN cuts/NNS was/VBD meant/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT core/NN message/NN from/IN his/PRP$ interview/NN on/IN the/DT BBC/NNP One's/NNP Breakfast/NN with/IN Frost/NNP programme./NN
He/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ shadow/NN Chancellor/NNP Oliver/NNP Letwin/NNP have/VBP been/VBN edging/VBG towards/IN an/DT announcement/NN on/IN this/DT front/NN for/IN some/DT months/NNS now/RB but/CC without/IN any/DT concrete/JJ pledges./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Howard/NNP announced/VBD that/IN of/IN the/DT £35bn/CD he/PRP has/VBZ earmarked/VBN from/IN savings/NNS £12bn/CD will/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO plug/VB Labour's/NNP claimed/VBD financial/JJ black/JJ hole/NN with/IN any/DT left/VBN over/IN going/VBG to/TO tax/VB cuts/NNS in/IN Mr/NNP Letwin's/NNP first/JJ budget./NN
He/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB precise/JJ but/CC there/EX are/VBP already/RB suggestions/NNS he/PRP is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO announce/VB lifting/VBG the/DT threshold/NN on/IN income/NN tax/NN and/CC reforming/VBG or/CC abolishing/VBG inheritance/NN tax./NN
But/CC he/PRP did/VBD for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN say/VBP there/EX would/MD be/VB such/JJ tax/NN cuts./NN

"At/NN this/DT election/NN people/NNS will/MD have/VB a/DT clear/JJ choice/NN between/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP who/WP will/MD waste/VB more/JJR and/CC tax/NN more/JJR and/CC the/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN which/WDT will/MD give/VB value/NN for/IN money/NN and/CC tax/NN less"./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Tories'/NNP attempt/NN to/TO open/VB that/IN famed/JJ "clear/NN blue/JJ water"/NN between/IN them/PRP and/CC the/DT Labour/NNP party/NN and/CC return/NN to/TO a/DT traditional/JJ Tory/NNP agenda/NN that/WDT will/MD both/DT reassure/VBP the/DT middle/NN England/NNP voters/NNS who/WP have/VBP abandoned/VBN him/PRP and/CC appeal/NN to/TO core/VB Conservative/JJ voters./NN
So/RB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB safe/JJ bet/NN to/TO assume/VB that/IN when/WRB Robert/NNP Jackson/NNP finally/RB decided/VBD to/TO jump/VB ship/NN and/CC swim/VBP over/RP to/TO the/DT Labour/NNP benches/VBZ his/PRP$ new/JJ masters/NNS decided/VBD to/TO time/NN the/DT announcement/NN for/IN the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ impact./NN
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP however/RB was/VBD dismissive./JJ
"These/NN things/NNS happen/VBP from/IN time/NN to/TO time./VB
There/EX are/VBP disagreements/NNS between/IN Robert/NNP Jackson/NNP and/CC me./NN

"The/NN election/NN is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB decided/VBN on/IN what/WP Robert/NNP Jackson/NNP did"/NN he/PRP added./VB
And/CC that/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB true./NN
The/DT election/NN will/MD be/VB decided/VBN on/IN "the/NN economy/NN stupid"./NN
Other/JJ issues/NNS like/IN the/DT Iraq/NNP war/NN and/CC the/DT "trust"/NN thing/NN will/MD also/RB play/VB a/DT major/JJ part./NN
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT economy/NN that/WDT will/MD probably/RB be/VB the/DT greatest/JJS influence/NN over/IN the/DT way/NN people/NNS finally/RB vote./VBP
And/CC many/JJ on/IN the/DT Tory/NNP benches/NNS have/VBP been/VBN crying/VBG out/RP for/IN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP to/TO get/VB back/RB onto/IN the/DT old/JJ Tory/NNP tax/NN cuts/VBZ agenda./NN
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP knows/VBZ that/IN risks/NNS accusations/NNS that/IN as/IN a/DT result/NN he/PRP would/MD slash/VB public/JJ services/NNS so/IN he/PRP has/VBZ attempted/VBN to/TO shoot/VB that/DT fox/NN first./NN
With/IN polls/NNS suggesting/VBG voters/NNS would/MD rather/RB any/DT government/NN cash/NN surpluses/NNS were/VBD spent/VBN on/IN schools/NNS and/CC hospitals/NNS before/IN tax/NN cuts/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ suggested/VBN that/WDT is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP he/PRP will/MD do./VB
Whether/IN this/DT will/MD finally/RB be/VB enough/RB to/TO shift/VB those/DT polls/NNS remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen./NN
