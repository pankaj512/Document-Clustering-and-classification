He/PRP said/VBD the/DT Law/NNP Lords'/NNP ruling/NN was/VBD an/DT "embarrassment"/NN for/IN the/DT government/NN and/CC major/JJ changes/NNS were/VBD needed/VBN to/TO the/DT law./NN

The/DT ruling/NN came/VBD on/IN Charles/NNP Clarke's/NNP first/JJ day/NN as/IN home/NN secretary/NN following/VBG David/NNP Blunkett's/NNP resignation./NN
In/IN a/DT statement/NN to/TO MPs/NNP Mr/NNP Clarke/NNP said/VBD "I/NN will/MD be/VB asking/VBG Parliament/NNP to/TO renew/VB this/DT legislation/NN in/IN the/DT New/NNP Year./NNP

The/DT government/NN opted/VBD out/IN of/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT European/NNP Convention/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP concerning/VBG the/DT right/NN to/TO a/DT fair/JJ trial/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO bring/VB in/RP anti-terrorism/JJ legislation/NN in/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT 11/CD September/NNP attacks/NNS in/IN the/DT US./NNP

On/IN Thursday/NNP Lord/NNP Bingham/NNP -/: a/DT senior/JJ law/NN lord/NN -/: said/VBD the/DT rules/NNS were/VBD incompatible/JJ with/IN the/DT European/NNP Convention/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP as/IN they/PRP allowed/VBD detentions/NNS "in/VBP a/DT way/NN that/IN discriminates/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN of/IN nationality/NN or/CC immigration/NN status"/NN by/IN justifying/VBG detention/NN without/IN trial/NN for/IN foreign/JJ suspects/NNS but/CC not/RB Britons./NNP
