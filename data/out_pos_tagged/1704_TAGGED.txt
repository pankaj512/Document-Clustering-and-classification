Leicester/NNP wing/NN Austin/NNP Healey/NNP hopes/VBZ to/TO use/VB Sunday's/NNP return/NN Heineken/NNP Cup/NNP clash/NN with/IN Wasps/NNP as/IN a/DT further/JJ springboard/NN to/TO an/DT England/NNP recall/VB for/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations./NNP

Healey/NNP who/WP won/VBD 51/CD caps/NNS prior/RB to/TO the/DT 2003/CD World/NNP Cup/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN good/JJ form/NN in/IN the/DT Tigers'/NNP resurgence/NN this/DT season./NN
"I/NN definitely/RB still/RB have/VBP ambitions/NNS to/TO play/VB for/IN England"/NNP Healey/NNP told/VBD the/DT BBC./NNP
"We/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO see/VB what/WP happens/VBZ after/IN the/DT previous/JJ (autumn)/NN Tests/NNS but/CC when/WRB I/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT current/JJ squad/NN I/PRP definitely/RB feel/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT place/NN there/RB for/IN me."/NN Healey/NNP who/WP has/VBZ also/RB played/VBN both/DT half-back/JJ positions/NNS and/CC full-back/JJ during/IN his/PRP$ career/NN has/VBZ reverted/VBN to/TO the/DT wing/NN where/WRB he/PRP won/VBD most/JJS of/IN his/PRP$ England/NNP caps./NN
After/IN recovering/VBG from/IN a/DT trapped/VBN nerve/NN in/IN his/PRP$ back/RB sustained/VBN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN September/NNP the/DT 31-year-old/JJ is/VBZ relishing/VBG his/PRP$ role/NN in/IN the/DT Tigers/NNP revival./NN
"I/NN had/VBD six/CD weeks/NNS out/RP but/CC fortunately/RB I/PRP have/VBP resumed/VBN the/DT sort/NN of/IN form/NN I/PRP had/VBD before"/NN he/PRP said./VB

"I/NN am/VBP basically/RB playing/VBG where/WRB it/PRP best/JJS suits/NNS Leicester./NNP
Obviously/RB I/PRP can/MD play/VB scrum-half/JJ fly-half/JJ or/CC full-back/JJ at/IN a/DT moment's/NNS notice./NN
"But/NN playing/VBG on/IN the/DT wing/NN actually/RB gives/VBZ me/PRP a/DT bigger/JJR free/JJ role/NN to/TO come/VB in/IN where/WRB I/PRP am/VBP not/RB expected/VBN and/CC influence/NN things."/NN That/DT has/VBZ been/VBN apparent/JJ in/IN parts/NNS one/CD and/CC two/CD of/IN the/DT Wasps-Leicester/NNP trilogy/NN in/IN recent/JJ weeks./NN
First/NNP Healey/NNP came/VBD off/RP his/PRP$ flank/NN with/IN an/DT angled/VBN run/NN to/TO score/VB an/DT injury-time/JJ try/NN that/WDT earned/VBD the/DT Tigers/NNP a/DT 17-17/JJ draw/NN in/IN their/PRP$ Premiership/NN meeting/NN on/IN 21/CD November./NNP
Then/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ of/IN their/PRP$ Heineken/NNP cup/NN double/JJ header/NN last/JJ Sunday/NNP Healey/NNP slotted/VBD in/IN at/IN stand-off/JJ and/CC delivered/VBD a/DT superb/NN cross-kick/JJ for/IN Martin/NNP Corry/NNP to/TO score/VB the/DT Tigers'/NNP third/JJ try./NN
"I/NN caught/VBD 'Cozza's'/NN eye/NN a/DT couple/NN of/IN phases/NNS before/IN that/DT and/CC was/VBD hoping/VBG to/TO get/VB it/PRP to/TO him/PRP on/IN the/DT full/JJ but/CC fortunately/RB even/RB with/IN the/DT bounce/NN he/PRP managed/VBD to/TO score"/VB Healey/NNP recalled./NN

Healey/NNP twice/RB a/DT Heineken/NNP Cup/NNP winner/NN believes/VBZ last/JJ Sunday's/NNP match/VB was/VBD "up/NN there"/NN with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT biggest/JJS club/NN contests/NNS he/PRP has/VBZ played/VBN in./NN
"It/NN was/VBD a/DT very/RB intense/JJ occasion/NN and/CC a/DT very/RB destructive/JJ game"/NN he/PRP recalled./VB
"There/NN was/VBD not/RB a/DT huge/JJ amount/NN of/IN rugby/NN played/VBD but/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ game/NN to/TO be/VB involved/VBN in./NN
"After/NN about/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS I/PRP thought/VBD we/PRP might/MD stride/VB away/RB with/IN it/PRP but/CC Wasps/NNP really/RB came/VBD back/RB into/IN it/PRP and/CC in/IN the/DT last/JJ couple/NN of/IN minutes/NNS it/PRP could/MD have/VB gone/VBN either/DT way."/NN

The/DT same/JJ outcome/NN this/DT Sunday/NNP would/MD put/VB Leicester/NNP in/IN pole/NN position/NN to/TO top/VB their/PRP$ Heineken/NNP pool/NN with/IN a/DT home/NN game/NN against/IN Biarritz/NNP and/CC away/RB trip/NN to/TO Calvisano/NNP to/TO come./VB
But/CC Healey/NNP insists/VBZ the/DT Tigers/NNP must/MD summon/VB the/DT same/JJ desire/NN if/IN they/PRP are/VBP to/TO deliver/VB the/DT knockout/NN blow/NN in/IN what/WP has/VBZ been/VBN dubbed/VBN "rugby's/NN version/NN of/IN Rocky/NNP II"./NNP
"There/NN was/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN satisfaction/NN in/IN the/DT dressing/VBG room/NN aftewards/NNS but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB only/RB a/DT case/NN of/IN a/DT job/NN half/JJ done"/NN he/PRP added./VB
"It/NN was/VBD the/DT first/JJ of/IN a/DT two-leg/JJ trip/NN and/CC if/IN we/PRP lose/VBP at/IN Welford/NNP Road/NNP it/PRP will/MD negate/VB all/PDT the/DT positives/NNS we/PRP can/MD take/VB from/IN result./NN
"I/NN think/VBP it/PRP came/VBD down/RB to/TO who/WP wanted/VBD it/PRP more/JJR and/CC in/IN the/DT end/NN I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP did./VBP
We/PRP have/VBP got/VBN to/TO show/VB the/DT same/JJ desire/NN again/RB this/DT week."/NN
