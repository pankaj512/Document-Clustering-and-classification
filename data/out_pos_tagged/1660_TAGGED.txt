Moore/NN questions/NNS captaincy/NN

Brian/NNP Moore/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT England/NNP captain/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT full-back./JJ

Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP has/VBZ led/VBN the/DT team/NN during/IN their/PRP$ opening/NN three/CD defeats/VBZ in/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS tournament/NN in/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN fly-half/JJ Jonny/NNP Wilkinson./NNP
The/DT world/NN champions/NNS have/VBP struggled/VBN since/IN the/DT retirement/NN of/IN former/JJ captain/NN Martin/NNP Johnson/NNP a/DT lock/NN forward./NN
And/CC former/JJ England/NNP captain/NN Moore/NNP told/VBD the/DT BBC/NNP "Full-backs/JJ are/VBP too/RB far/RB away/RB from/IN the/DT action./NN
That's/NNP not/RB a/DT reflection/NN on/IN Robinson/NNP personally."/NN He/PRP added/VBD "I/NN just/RB think/VBP the/DT point/NN of/IN influence/NN needs/VBZ to/TO move/VB closer/JJR to/TO the/DT pack/NN -/: which/WDT is/VBZ after/IN all/DT where/WRB games/NNS usually/RB start/VBP and/CC finish."/NN Moore/NNP says/VBZ a/DT lack/NN of/IN cohesion/NN in/IN the/DT forwards/RB is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB England/NNP have/VBP lost/VBN against/IN Wales/NNP France/NNP and/CC Ireland/NNP in/IN this/DT year's/NNS tournament./NN
"Assertiveness/NN in/IN the/DT pack/NN isn't/NN there/EX we're/NN not/RB getting/VBG enough/JJ people/NNS into/IN the/DT breakdowns"/NN he/PRP explained./VB
"Wer'e/NN not/RB getting/VBG quick/JJ ball/NN which/WDT means/VBZ the/DT backs/NNS are/VBP being/VBG stifled./NN
Their/PRP$ creativity/NN depends/VBZ on/IN quick/JJ ball/NN and/CC we're/NN not/RB getting/VBG that."/NN

With/IN injuries/NNS depriving/VBG him/PRP of/IN key/JJ players/NNS like/IN Wilkinson/NNP coach/NN Andy/NNP Robinson/NNP has/VBZ given/VBN youngsters/NNS such/JJ as/IN Harry/NNP Ellis/NNP and/CC Jamie/NNP Noon/NN a/DT chance./NN
And/CC Moore/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT last/JJ two/CD games/NNS against/IN Italy/NNP and/CC Scotland/NNP are/VBP a/DT good/JJ opportunity/NN to/TO experiment/VB further./NN
"The/NN problem/NN is/VBZ the/DT players/NNS that/WDT are/VBP around/RP to/TO replace/VB the/DT icons/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN lost/VBN because/IN of/IN retirement/NN and/CC injury/NN don't/NN have/VBP the/DT requisite/JJ experience"/NN Moore/NNP added./NN
"You/NN can't/NN do/VBP anything/NN about/IN that/DT but/CC play/VB them./NN
There/EX are/VBP players/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN knocking/VBG on/IN the/DT door/NN it's/NNS time/NN for/IN them/PRP to/TO be/VB looked/VBN at/IN in/IN these/DT last/JJ two/CD games/NNS because/IN there's/NNS nothing/NN on/IN them./NN
"We/NN then/RB go/VB into/IN next/JJ season/NN with/IN a/DT greater/JJR certainty/NN of/IN who/WP can/MD and/CC cannot/NN handle/VBP the/DT pressure/NN of/IN international/JJ rugby."/NN
