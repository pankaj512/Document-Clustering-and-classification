DVD/NNP review/NN I/PRP Robot/VBP

Only/RB one/CD man/NN recognises/NNS that/IN robots/NNS are/VBP a/DT threat/NN to/TO humanity/NN -/: but/CC that's/NNS fine/NN because/IN it/PRP only/RB takes/VBZ one/CD man/NN to/TO save/VB the/DT day/NN in/IN the/DT thriller/NN I/PRP Robot./NNP

Will/MD Smith/NNP co-stars/NNS alongside/IN more/JJR CGI/NNP robots/NNS than/IN you/PRP can/MD count/VB and/CC as/IN a/DT thrill-a-minute/JJ kind/NN of/IN action/NN film/NN it's/NNS perfectly/RB adequate./VBP
You'll/NNS have/VBP forgotten/VBN it/PRP all/DT tomorrow/NN but/CC you'll/NN have/VBP a/DT fun/NN night/NN with/IN the/DT film/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT extras./NN
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT one-disc/JJ version/NN that/WDT has/VBZ commentaries/NNS and/CC a/DT Making/NN Of/IN but/CC the/DT two-disc/JJ adds/VBZ more./NN
Unusually/RB for/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN film/NN the/DT extras/NNS don't/NN solely/RB concentrate/VB on/IN the/DT special/JJ effects./NN
They're/NNP covered/VBD but/CC there's/NNS also/RB a/DT general/JJ Production/NN Diary/NNP and/CC a/DT Post-Production/JJ feature./NN

Remember/VB the/DT National/NNP Lottery's/NNP draw/VBP machines/NNS Arthur/NNP and/CC Guinevere?/NNP They/PRP were/VBD more/RBR accurate/JJ than/IN this/DT glossy/JJ Hollywood/NNP version/NN of/IN the/DT tale./NN

But/CC as/RB long/RB as/IN you're/NN not/RB expecting/VBG a/DT documentary/NN live/NN with/IN it/PRP King/NNP Arthur/NNP is/VBZ a/DT fun/NN exciting/JJ totally/RB shallow/JJ experience/NN and/CC looks/VBZ excellent./NN
Clive/NNP Owen/NNP is/VBZ the/DT brooding/VBG king/NN Keira/NNP Knightly/NNP rises/NNS above/IN her/PRP$ costume/NN and/CC Ray/NNP Winstone/NNP gives/VBZ it/PRP all/PDT some/DT grit./NN
It's/NNP at/IN its/PRP$ best/JJS in/IN its/PRP$ battle/NN scenes/NNS which/WDT are/VBP well/RB done/VBN and/CC are/VBP also/RB the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT Making/NN Of/IN extra./NN

Less/RBR flashy/JJ than/IN a/DT David/NNP Attenborough/NNP show/NN and/CC less/RBR detailed/VBN than/IN a/DT Simon/NNP Schama/NNP one/CD the/DT BBC/NNP series/NN British/NNP Isles/NNP nevertheless/RB turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB quite/RB engrossing./NN
Admit/VB it/PRP the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT shows/NNS Alan/NNP Titchmarsh/NNP left/VBD Ground/NNP Force/NNP to/TO present/NN did/VBD mean/VB that/IN you/PRP expected/VBD something/NN equally/RB frothy./NN
But/CC Titchmarsh/NNP turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO know/VB his/PRP$ subject/JJ and/CC the/DT sight/NN of/IN our/PRP$ present-day/JJ landscape/NN being/VBG peeled/VBN back/RB to/TO reveal/VB the/DT past/NN was/VBD fascinating./NN
He's/NNP now/RB written/VBD an/DT accompanying/VBG book/NN too./NN
