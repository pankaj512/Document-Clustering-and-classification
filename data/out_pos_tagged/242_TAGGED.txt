"No-one/JJ knows/VBZ what/WP this/DT guy/NN will/MD be/VB bringing/VBG to/TO the/DT table."/NN

The/DT key/NN to/TO any/DT successful/JJ bid/NN will/MD be/VB attracting/VBG the/DT support/NN of/IN United's/NNP largest/JJS shareholders/NNS the/DT Irish/JJ horse/NN racing/VBG tycoons/NNS John/NNP Magnier/NNP and/CC JP/NNP McManus./NNP

Indeed/RB it/PRP is./VBD
Malcolm/NNP Glazer/NNP was/VBD little-known/JJ in/IN the/DT UK/NNP until/IN he/PRP started/VBD to/TO build/VB up/RP his/PRP$ stake/NN in/IN Manchester/NNP United/NNP in/IN late/JJ 2003./CD

No/DT bid/NN emerged/VBD but/CC Mr/NNP Glazer/NNP continued/VBD to/TO increase/VB his/PRP$ holding/VBG in/IN the/DT club./NN
In/IN October/NNP 2004/CD Manchester/NNP United/NNP said/VBD they/PRP had/VBD received/VBN a/DT "preliminary/JJ approach"/NN which/WDT turned/VBD out/RP to/TO have/VB come/VBN from/IN Mr/NNP Glazer./NNP
However/RB the/DT board/NN rejected/VBD the/DT move/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN debt/NN it/PRP would/MD involve./VB
At/IN the/DT club's/NNS annual/JJ general/JJ meeting/NN in/IN November/NNP Mr/NNP Glazer/NNP took/VBD revenge/NN by/IN using/VBG his/PRP$ hefty/JJ stake/NN in/IN the/DT club/NN to/TO oust/VB three/CD directors/NNS from/IN the/DT board./NN
