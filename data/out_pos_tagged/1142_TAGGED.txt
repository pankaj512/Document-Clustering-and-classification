Increasingly/RB more/JJR women/NNS than/IN men/NNS went/VBD to/TO university/NN while/IN tuition/NN fees/NNS and/CC student/NN loans/NNS made/VBD no/DT major/JJ difference./NN

The/DT Hefce/NNP report/NN drawing/VBG on/IN child/NN benefits/NNS data/NNS said/VBD teenagers/NNS in/IN the/DT richest/JJS areas/NNS could/MD expect/VB a/DT better/JJR than/IN 50%/CD chance/NN of/IN going/VBG to/TO university/NN while/IN in/IN the/DT poorest/JJS neighbourhoods/NNS it/PRP was/VBD 10%./CD

Sir/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD the/DT report/NN highlighted/VBD the/DT "entrenched/VBN divisions"/NN between/IN rich/JJ and/CC poor/JJ areas/NNS but/CC added/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT social/NN as/RB much/JJ as/IN an/DT educational/JJ problem./NN
He/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP News/NNP "We/NN know/NN once/RB children/NNS from/IN deprived/VBN backgrounds/NNS get/VBP into/IN university/NN they/PRP do/VBP very/RB well./NN
In/IN fact/NN surprisingly/RB more/RBR go/NN into/IN postgraduate/NN study/NN than/IN those/DT from/IN more/RBR affluent/JJ backgrounds./NN
"The/NN issue/NN is/VBZ I/PRP think/VBP one/CD of/IN raising/VBG aspirations/NNS amongst/IN those/DT families/NNS and/CC those/DT communities/NNS that/DT university/NN is/VBZ something/NN for/IN them/PRP and/CC not/RB for/IN other/JJ people."/NN

He/PRP said/VBN by/IN the/DT time/NN universities/NNS traditionally/RB dealt/VBD with/IN pupils/NNS between/IN the/DT ages/NNS of/IN 16/CD and/CC 18/CD it/PRP was/VBD too/RB late./NN

Tuition/NN fees/NNS and/CC student/NN loans/NNS in/IN England/NNP and/CC Wales/NNP -/: and/CC the/DT different/JJ fee/NN regime/NN in/IN Scotland/NNP -/: did/VBD not/RB seem/VB to/TO have/VB affected/VBN the/DT choices/NNS of/IN young/JJ people/NNS even/RB the/DT poorest./NN
