Boro/NNP who/WP are/VBP playing/VBG in/IN Europe/NNP for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN their/PRP$ 128-year/JJ history/NN are/VBP top/NN of/IN Group/NNP E/NN with/IN maximum/NN points./NN
"I/NN think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN to/TO Europe/NNP really/RB well"/NN said/VBD McClaren./NNP
"We/NN got/VBD about/IN Lazio/NNP didn't/NN let/NN them/PRP settle/VB or/CC play./NN
And/CC in/IN possession/NN we/PRP controlled/VBD it/PRP and/CC looked/VBD threatening/VBG every/DT time/NN we/PRP went/VBD forward."/NN Before/IN the/DT match/NN McClaren/NNP had/VBD said/VBN that/IN a/DT win/NN over/IN the/DT Italian/JJ giants/NNS would/MD put/VB Boro/NNP firmly/RB on/IN the/DT European/JJ footballing/NN map./NN
And/CC after/IN they/PRP did/VBD just/RB that/IN he/PRP said/VBD "It/NN was/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ European/JJ night./NN
For/IN the/DT team/NN to/TO give/VB the/DT fans/NNS a/DT performance/NN like/IN that/DT was/VBD the/DT icing/NN on/IN the/DT cake./NN
"There/NN have/VBP been/VBN many/JJ good/JJ performances/NNS but/CC this/DT was/VBD something/NN special./NN

"You/NN can/MD see/VB that/IN the/DT experience/NN we/PRP have/VBP in/IN the/DT squad/NN is/VBZ showing./NN
To/TO win/VB in/IN Europe/NNP you/PRP need/VBP to/TO defend/VB well/RB and/CC we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN that/IN because/IN we/PRP have/VBP conceded/VBN only/RB one/CD goal/NN in/IN four/CD games./NN
"We/NN can/MD also/RB score/VB goals/NNS and/CC again/RB that/WDT is/VBZ something/NN you/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN the/DT performances/NNS we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN so/IN we/PRP have/VBP good/JJ balance./NN
McClaren's/NNP only/RB criticism/NN of/IN his/PRP$ side/NN was/VBD that/IN their/PRP$ dominance/NN should/MD have/VB been/VBN resulted/VBN in/IN more/JJR goals./NN
"It/NN should/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR convincing"/NN said/VBD McClaren./NNP
"But/NN I/PRP had/VBD watched/VBN Lazio/NNP in/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS and/CC I/PRP saw/VBD them/PRP score/VB a/DT late/JJ equaliser/NN against/IN Inter/NNP Milan/NNP on/IN Saturday/NNP so/IN I/PRP knew/VBD we/PRP needed/VBD a/DT second/JJ goal./NN

"No/NN matter/NN what/WP anybody/NN says/VBZ Lazio/NNP are/VBP favourites/NNS to/TO win/VB this/DT competition."/NN Middlesbrough/NNP forward/RB Boudewijn/NNP Zenden/NNP said/VBD he/PRP did/VBD not/RB expect/VB such/PDT a/DT comfortable/JJ match/NN after/IN he/PRP scored/VBD both/DT goals./NN
"We/NN didn't/NN expect/VBP it/PRP to/TO be/VB that/IN one-sided"/NN said/VBD Zenden./NNP
"We/NN did/VBD quite/RB well/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN we/PRP pressured/VBD them/PRP and/CC they/PRP didn't/VBP cope/NN with/IN that./NN
"I/NN think/VBP we/PRP played/VBD quite/RB well/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ game/NN especially/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ half."/NN The/DT Holland/NNP international/NN said/VBD Boro/NNP are/VBP confident/JJ of/IN progressing/VBG in/IN the/DT competition/NN after/IN winning/VBG their/PRP$ first/JJ two/CD group/NN games./NN
