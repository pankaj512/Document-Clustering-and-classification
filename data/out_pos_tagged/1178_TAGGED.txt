Tony/NNP Blair/NNP has/VBZ launched/VBN an/DT attack/NN on/IN Conservative/JJ spending/NN plans/NNS saying/VBG they/PRP are/VBP a/DT "ludicrous/JJ improbability"./NN

The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN has/VBZ told/VBN a/DT Labour/NNP Party/NNP gathering/VBG that/IN the/DT Tory/NNP policies/NNS would/MD cause/VB economic/JJ failure./NN
Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN his/PRP$ party/NN would/MD cut/VB £35bn/CD in/IN "wasteful"/NN spending/NN to/TO allow/VB £4bn/CD in/IN tax/NN cuts./NN
On/IN Saturday/NNP Tory/NNP shadow/NN home/NN secretary/NN David/NNP Davis/NNP said/VBD the/DT Tories/NNPS would/MD fund/VB the/DT cuts/NNS by/IN removing/VBG "inefficiencies"/NN which/WDT had/VBD "burgeoned"/NN under/IN Labour./NNP
In/IN his/PRP$ speech/NN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP contrasted/VBD a/DT reformed/VBN Labour/NNP party/NN which/WDT had/VBD learned/VBN to/TO occupy/VB the/DT political/JJ centre/NN ground/NN with/IN a/DT hidebound/JJ Tory/NNP party/NN which/WDT he/PRP said/VBD would/MD turn/VB the/DT clock/NN back/RB with/IN spending/NN cuts./NN
Mr/NNP Blair/NNP said/VBD "The/NN Conservative/JJ tax/NN and/CC spending/NN proposals/NNS would/MD put/VB at/IN risk/NN both/DT Britain's/NNP hard-won/JJ economic/JJ stability/NN -/: the/DT lowest/JJS mortgages/NNS inflation/NN unemployment/NN for/IN decades/NNS -/: and/CC the/DT key/JJ investment/NN in/IN public/JJ services./NN

"I/NN believe/VBP that/IN the/DT Tory/NNP plans/VBZ are/VBP as/RB plain/JJ a/DT call/NN to/TO return/VB to/TO the/DT past/NN as/IN it's/NNS possible/JJ to/TO imagine"/VB he/PRP said./VB
"It's/NN a/DT recipe/NN for/IN exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ boom/NN and/CC bust/NN economics/NNS and/CC cuts/NNS in/IN public/JJ services/NNS that/WDT were/VBD their/PRP$ hallmark/NN in/IN 18/CD years/NNS of/IN Conservative/JJ government."/NN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP added/VBD "They/NN the/DT Conservatives/NNS have/VBP learned/VBN nothing."/NN By/IN contrast/NN he/PRP said/VBD New/NNP Labour/NNP had/VBD listened/VBN to/TO its/PRP$ electorate/NN and/CC changed./NN

Mr/NNP Blair/NNP went/VBD on/IN to/TO list/VB his/PRP$ government's/NNS achievements/NNS and/CC to/TO issue/VB a/DT rallying/VBG call/NN to/TO the/DT party./NN
"So/NN now/RB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT choice/NN we/PRP can/MD defend/VB this/DT record/NN and/CC we/PRP can/MD build/VB on/IN it/PRP and/CC go/VB on/IN and/CC fulfil/VB the/DT promise/NN or/CC give/VB up/RB and/CC go/VB back./NN
And/CC I/PRP say/VBP we/PRP have/VBP to/TO fight."/VB In/IN response/NN David/NNP Davis/NNP said/VBD the/DT Tories/NNPS would/MD make/VB cuts/NNS such/JJ as/IN removing/VBG regional/JJ assemblies/NNS but/CC would/MD bring/VB in/RP more/JJR police/NN officers/NNS and/CC match/VB Labour's/NNP spending/NN on/IN health/NN and/CC education./NN
"Everybody/NN knows/VBZ having/VBG lived/VBD through/IN this/DT government/NN the/DT last/JJ seven/CD years/NNS that/IN they/PRP faced/VBD lots/NNS of/IN stealth/NN tactics/NNS lots/NNS of/IN increases/NNS in/IN taxes/NNS but/CC no/DT improvement/NN in/IN public/JJ services"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Mr/NNP Davis/NNP said/VBD Labour/NNP had/VBD been/VBN responsible/JJ for/IN "huge/NN waste/NN huge/JJ overspending/NN not/RB on/IN the/DT frontline/NN at/IN all/DT but/CC on/IN bureaucracy"./NN
"The/NN public/JJ face/NN a/DT choice/NN between/IN more/JJR waste/NN and/CC more/JJR taxes/NNS with/IN this/DT government/NN less/JJR waste/NN and/CC lower/JJR taxes/NNS with/IN a/DT Tory/NNP government"/NN he/PRP concluded./VB

Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP has/VBZ addressed/VBN the/DT conference/NN behind/IN closed/VBD doors./NN
The/DT Chancellor/NNP said/VBD the/DT Conservatives'/NNP plans/VBZ would/MD see/VB some/DT £50bn/CD in/IN spending/NN cuts/NNS by/IN 2011/CD which/WDT the/DT Tories/NNPS deny./NN
Mr/NNP Brown/NNP also/RB issued/VBD call/NN for/IN party/NN unity/NN and/CC warn/VBP of/IN the/DT dangers/NNS of/IN allowing/VBG themselves/PRP to/TO be/VB "distracted/VBN or/CC diverted"./NN
According/VBG to/TO an/DT advance/NN text/NN released/VBN by/IN officials/NNS he/PRP told/VBD delegates/NNS "We/NN must/MD all/DT show/NN the/DT strength/NN and/CC unity/NN of/IN purpose/NN to/TO take/VB the/DT long-term/JJ decisions/NNS necessary/JJ to/TO meet/VB them."/NN

Meanwhile/RB Tory/NNP shadow/NN chancellor/NN Oliver/NNP Letwin/NNP accused/VBD Mr/NNP Blair/NNP of/IN "misrepresenting"/NN the/DT party's/NNS proposals/NNS and/CC questioned/VBD how/WRB Labour/NNP would/MD fund/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ plans./NN
"He/NN still/RB cannot/NN accept/VBP the/DT simple/JJ truth/NN which/WDT is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP will/MD spend/VB more/JJR on/IN what/WP matters/NNS to/TO people/NNS -/: schools/NNS hospitals/NNS and/CC police/NN -/: and/CC that/IN we/PRP will/MD offer/VB value/NN for/IN money/NN and/CC lower/JJR taxes"/NN Mr/NNP Letwin/NNP said./NN
"Once/NN again/RB Mr/NNP Blair/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ Chancellor/NNP have/VBP failed/VBN to/TO answer/VB the/DT question/NN that/WDT lies/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN this/DT election/NN -/: which/WDT taxes/NNS will/MD they/PRP put/VB up/RP to/TO fill/VB the/DT £8bn/CD shortfall/NN in/IN their/PRP$ plans?"/NN
