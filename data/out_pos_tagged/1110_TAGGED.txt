There/EX was/VBD one/CD prison/NN suicide/NN every/DT four/CD days/NNS between/IN 1999/CD and/CC 2003/CD MPs/NNP said./NN
The/DT report/NN which/WDT followed/VBD a/DT year-long/JJ inquiry/NN by/IN the/DT committee/NN found/VBD the/DT high/JJ death/NN rate/NN "amounts/NN to/TO a/DT serious/JJ failure/NN to/TO protect/VB the/DT right/NN to/TO life/NN of/IN a/DT highly/RB vulnerable/JJ group"./NN

Many/JJ of/IN those/DT who/WP ended/VBD up/RP taking/VBG their/PRP$ own/JJ lives/NNS had/VBD "presented/VBN themselves"/NN to/TO the/DT authorities/NNS with/IN these/DT problems/NNS before/IN they/PRP even/RB offended/VBD the/DT report/NN said./NN

"Crime/NN levels/NNS are/VBP falling/VBG but/CC we/PRP are/VBP holding/VBG more/JJR people/NNS in/IN custody/NN than/IN ever/RB before./NN
The/DT misplaced/VBN over-reliance/JJ on/IN the/DT prison/NN system/NN for/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS vulnerable/JJ people/NNS in/IN the/DT country/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT problems/NNS that/IN we/PRP encountered./VBP
"Until/NN we/PRP change/VBP our/PRP$ whole/JJ approach/NN to/TO imprisoning/VBG vulnerable/JJ people/NNS we/PRP cannot/VBP begin/NN to/TO meet/VB our/PRP$ positive/JJ obligations/NNS under/IN Article/NNP 2/CD of/IN the/DT European/NNP Convention/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP and/CC meet/VB our/PRP$ duty/NN of/IN care/NN to/TO them."/VB
