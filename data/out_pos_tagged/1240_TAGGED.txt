Will/MD Tory/NNP tax/NN cuts/NNS lift/VBP spirits?/NN

Michael/NNP Howard/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB revealed/VBN the/DT full/JJ scale/NN of/IN his/PRP$ planned/VBN Tory/NNP tax/NN cuts./NN

Should/MD he/PRP win/VB the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election/NN he/PRP has/VBZ earmarked/VBN £4/CD billion/CD that/WDT will/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO reduce/VB taxes/NNS -/: although/IN he/PRP still/RB will/MD not/RB say/VB which/WDT or/CC how./NN
This/DT was/VBD the/DT pre-election/JJ message/NN many/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ party/NN have/VBP been/VBN pressing/VBG for/IN and/CC voters/NNS he/PRP believes/VBZ will/MD warm/VB to./NN
At/IN its/PRP$ simplest/JJS it/PRP is/VBZ saying/VBG "Vote/NN Tory/NNP and/CC you/PRP can/MD have/VB it/PRP both/DT ways"./NN
Not/RB only/RB would/MD his/PRP$ government/NN stick/VB to/TO Labour/NNP spending/NN plans/NNS on/IN core/NN public/JJ services/NNS including/VBG health/NN and/CC education/NN it/PRP would/MD increase/VB spending/NN on/IN defence/NN police/NN and/CC pensions./NN
And/CC even/RB after/IN that/DT was/VBD done/VBN it/PRP would/MD still/RB have/VB enough/RB left/VBN over/RP for/IN a/DT tax/NN cut/NN equivalent/JJ to/TO about/IN a/DT penny/NN off/RP the/DT basic/JJ rate/NN of/IN income/NN tax./NN

All/PDT the/DT money/NN would/MD come/VB from/IN its/PRP$ £35/CD billion/CD efficiency/NN savings/NNS which/WDT would/MD see/VB the/DT axe/NN taken/VBN to/TO bureaucracy/NN waste/NN and/CC the/DT civil/JJ service./NN
Of/IN that/DT £23/CD billion/CD would/MD go/VB on/IN spending/NN plans/NNS with/IN £8/CD billion/CD to/TO fill/VB the/DT black/JJ hole/NN left/VBD they/PRP claim/VBP by/IN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP and/CC the/DT rest/NN going/VBG in/IN tax/NN cuts./NN

Neither/DT Mr/NNP Howard/NNP nor/CC Mr/NNP Letwin/NNP would/MD say/VB exactly/RB how/WRB they/PRP would/MD use/VB that/DT cash/NN although/IN a/DT cut/NN in/IN the/DT basic/JJ rate/NN seems/VBZ unlikely./NN
Ideas/NNS already/RB floated/VBD include/VBP raising/VBG tax/NN thresholds/NNS and/CC abolishing/VBG or/CC reducing/VBG inheritance/NN tax/NN although/IN some/DT in/IN the/DT Tory/NNP party/NN are/VBP urging/VBG Mr/NNP Howard/NNP to/TO announce/VB something/NN more/RBR eye-catching/JJ before/IN the/DT election./NN
As/IN the/DT Tory/NNP leader/NN declared/VBD the/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT exercise/NN is/VBZ to/TO open/VB up/RP a/DT real/JJ economic/JJ policy/NN divide/VBP between/IN Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories./NNP
"At/NN this/DT election/NN people/NNS will/MD have/VB a/DT clear/JJ choice/NN between/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP who/WP will/MD waste/VB more/JJR and/CC tax/NN more/JJR and/CC the/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN which/WDT will/MD give/VB value/NN for/IN money/NN and/CC tax/NN less"/NN he/PRP said./VB

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT move/NN back/RB towards/IN an/DT almost/RB traditional/JJ Tory/NNP message/NN which/WDT previously/RB suggested/VBD Labour/NNP was/VBD the/DT party/NN of/IN tax/NN rises/NNS and/CC the/DT Conservatives/NNS the/DT party/NN of/IN tax/NN cuts./NN

The/DT extension/NN of/IN that/DT however/RB was/VBD that/IN Labour/NNP was/VBD also/RB seen/VBN as/IN the/DT party/NN of/IN big/JJ spending/NN on/IN the/DT public/JJ services/NNS while/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS were/VBD the/DT cutters./NN
And/CC that/DT is/VBZ where/WRB one/CD of/IN the/DT problems/NNS lies/VBZ for/IN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP -/: can/MD he/PRP persuade/VB sceptical/JJ voters/NNS that/IN they/PRP really/RB can/MD have/VB it/PRP both/DT ways/NNS with/IN bigger/JJR spending/NN on/IN public/JJ services/NNS AND/CC lower/JJR taxes?/NN He/PRP insists/VBZ he/PRP will/MD not/RB promise/VB anything/NN before/IN the/DT election/NN that/IN he/PRP cannot/VB deliver/NN if/IN put/NN into/IN Downing/NNP Street./NNP
Labour/NN needless/JJ to/TO say/VB claim/NN his/PRP$ planned/VBN £35bn/CD efficiency/NN savings/NNS simply/RB don't/VBP add/NN up/IN and/CC that/IN those/DT sorts/NNS of/IN figures/NNS are/VBP fantasy./NN

One/CD of/IN New/NNP Labour's/NNP greatest/JJS successes/NNS before/IN the/DT historic/JJ 1997/CD election/NN was/VBD to/TO persuade/VB voters/NNS business/NN and/CC the/DT City/NNP that/IN it/PRP could/MD be/VB trusted/VBN to/TO run/VB the/DT economy./NN
So/RB far/RB that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB faced/VBN any/DT real/JJ challenge/NN but/CC independent/JJ analysts/NNS now/RB claim/VBP a/DT third/JJ New/NNP Labour/NNP government/NN would/MD be/VB forced/VBN to/TO either/DT increase/NN taxation/NN or/CC taxes/NNS to/TO plug/VB a/DT black/JJ hole/NN it/PRP has/VBZ at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN its/PRP$ finances./NN
Meanwhile/RB the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS are/VBP committed/VBN to/TO increasing/VBG taxes/NNS for/IN the/DT most/RBS well/RB off/IN to/TO finance/VB their/PRP$ spending/NN proposals/NNS launched/VBN earlier/RBR in/IN the/DT day./NN
So/RB Mr/NNP Howard/NNP hopes/VBZ his/PRP$ message/NN will/MD start/VB to/TO hit/VB home/NN during/IN this/DT unofficial/JJ election/NN campaign/NN and/CC that/IN his/PRP$ poll/NN ratings/NNS might/MD finally/RB lift/VB off/RP the/DT floor./NN
And/CC while/IN other/JJ issues/NNS like/IN the/DT Iraq/NNP war/NN and/CC trust/NN will/MD play/VB a/DT major/JJ part/NN in/IN that/DT campaign/NN it/PRP is/VBZ likely/JJ -/: and/CC the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN probably/RB hopes/VBZ -/: that/IN the/DT economy/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT deciding/VBG factor./NN
