What/WP now/RB for/IN British/JJ tennis?/NN

Tim/NNP Henman's/NNP decision/NN to/TO quit/VB Davis/NNP Cup/NNP tennis/NN has/VBZ left/VBN the/DT British/JJ team/NN with/IN a/DT gargantuan/JJ void/NN to/TO fill./VB

The/DT world/NN number/NN seven/CD is/VBZ tied/VBN for/IN fourth/JJ among/IN his/PRP$ countrymen/NNS for/IN wins/VBZ in/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN the/DT tournament/NN (he/NN has/VBZ 36/CD from/IN his/PRP$ 50/CD rubbers)./NN
And/CC Great/NNP Britain's/NNP last/JJ Davis/NNP Cup/NNP win/VB without/IN Henman/NNP came/VBD against/IN Slovenia/NNP as/IN far/RB back/RB as/IN 1996./CD
Worse/JJR could/MD follow/VB according/VBG to/TO former/JJ British/JJ team/NN member/NN Chris/NNP Bailey./NNP
Bailey/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Sport/NNP "After/NN Tim's/NNP announcement/NN I/PRP doubt/VBP Greg/NNP Rusedski/NNP will/MD be/VB that/IN far/RB behind/IN him."/NN But/CC without/IN their/PRP$ top/JJ two/CD where/WRB does/VBZ that/WDT leave/VBP British/JJ ambitions/NNS in/IN the/DT sport's/NNS premier/NN team/NN event?/NN Captain/NN Jeremy/NNP Bates/NNP has/VBZ singled/VBN out/RP Alex/NNP Bogdanovic/NNP and/CC Andrew/NNP Murray/NNP as/IN potential/JJ replacements./NN
The/DT Yugoslavian-born/NNP Bogdanovic/NNP though/IN is/VBZ 184/CD places/NNS below/IN Henman/NNP in/IN the/DT world/NN rankings/NNS and/CC has/VBZ played/VBN just/RB two/CD cup/NN ties/NNS -/: winning/VBG one/CD and/CC losing/VBG the/DT other./NN

Murray/NNP on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ 407th/JJ in/IN the/DT current/JJ ATP/NNP entry/NN list/NN and/CC yet/RB to/TO make/VB his/PRP$ cup/NN debut./NN
But/CC Bailey/NNP does/VBZ see/VB some/DT hope/NN for/IN the/DT future./NN
He/PRP said/VBD "Now/NN we've/NN dropped/VBD down/RB to/TO the/DT Euro-Africa/NNP zone/NN the/DT time/NN was/VBD right/JJ for/IN him/PRP to/TO step/VB down/RP and/CC let/VB the/DT young/JJ guys/NNS come/VBP to/TO the/DT fore."/NN Britain's/NNP next/JJ opponents/NNS Israel/NNP are/VBP hardly/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB quaking/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ boots/NNS ahead/RB of/IN the/DT 4-6/JJ March/NNP match/VB against/IN a/DT likely/JJ trio/NN of/IN Bogdanovic/NNP Murray/NNP and/CC the/DT 187th-ranked/CD Arvind/NNP Parmar./NNP
Bailey/NNP said/VBD "It/NN will/MD be/VB tough/JJ for/IN GB/NNP to/TO move/VB up/RB but/CC there/EX comes/VBZ a/DT time/NN when/WRB our/PRP$ young/JJ players/NNS have/VBP to/TO step/VB up./NN
This/DT was/VBD always/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB inevitable/JJ with/IN Tim/NNP and/CC Greg's/NNP growing/VBG years./NN
"I'm/NN confident/JJ about/IN the/DT future./NN
I/PRP wouldn't/VBP lay/VBD money/NN on/IN us/PRP getting/VBG back/RB into/IN the/DT world/NN group/NN next/JJ year/NN but/CC I'd/NNP imagine/VBP in/IN five/CD years/NNS time/NN we'll/NN be/VB competing/VBG for/IN the/DT major/JJ honours."/NN Of/IN those/DT lining/VBG up/RP to/TO replace/VB Henman/NNP the/DT 17-year-old/JJ Murray/NNP with/IN four/CD Futures/NNPS titles/NNS under/IN his/PRP$ belt/NN last/JJ year/NN looks/VBZ the/DT best/JJS long-term/JJ bet./NN
"Murray/NN is/VBZ the/DT one/NN that/WDT looks/VBZ likeliest/JJS to/TO take/VB over/RP Tim's/NNP mantle"/NN said/VBD Bailey./NNP
"He/NN has/VBZ an/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN self-confidence/NN judging/VBG by/IN what/WP he's/NNS said/VBD in/IN the/DT past."/NN Bogdanovic/NNP three/CD years/NNS Murray's/NNP senior/JJ has/VBZ had/VBN a/DT more/RBR troubled/JJ time/NN under/IN Britain's/NNP Davis/NNP Cup/NNP umbrella./NN

While/IN Murray/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN marked/VBN out/RP as/IN Britain's/NNP golden/JJ boy/NN Bogdanovic/NNP was/VBD warned/VBN by/IN the/DT Lawn/NN Tennis/NNP Association/NNP for/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN drive/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2003./CD
And/CC Bailey/NNP said/VBD "Despite/NN that/IN Alex/NNP is/VBZ clearly/RB talented/VBN as/RB well/RB while/IN Arvind/NNP is/VBZ another/DT contender./NN
"They're/NN among/IN the/DT guys/NNS who/WP have/VBP experienced/VBN the/DT intensity/NN of/IN Davis/NNP Cup/NNP tennis/NN -/: whether/IN as/IN players/NNS or/CC on/IN the/DT sidelines./NN
