-/: Withdrawing/VBG from/IN the/DT 1951/CD United/NNP Nations/NNPS Convention/NNP on/IN refugees/NNS which/WDT obliges/VBZ countries/NNS to/TO accept/VB people/NNS being/VBG persecuted/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN need/VBP not/RB numbers/NNS
-/: Introduce/VB laws/NNS to/TO allow/VB the/DT immediate/JJ removal/NN of/IN asylum/NN seekers/NNS whose/WP$ claims/NNS were/VBD clearly/RB unfounded/JJ because/IN they/PRP came/VBD from/IN safe/JJ countries/NNS or/CC had/VBD destroyed/VBN documents/NNS
-/: Detain/NNP asylum/NN seekers/NNS without/IN documents/NNS so/IN people/NNS whose/WP$ identity/NN was/VBD not/RB known/VBN were/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO move/VB freely/RB around/IN the/DT UK/NNP -/: a/DT worry/NN for/IN "national/JJ security"/NN

Anyone/NN applying/VBG for/IN asylum/NN would/MD be/VB taken/VBN to/TO new/JJ centres/NNS close/VBP to/TO their/PRP$ countries/NNS of/IN origin./NN



The/DT Tories/NNPS also/RB want/VBP quotas/NNS for/IN those/DT seeking/VBG work/NN permits/VBZ through/IN an/DT Australian-style/JJ points/NNS system/NN and/CC those/DT wanting/VBG to/TO join/VB families/NNS in/IN the/DT UK./NNP

The/DT plans/NNS would/MD help/VB achieve/VB a/DT "substantial/JJ reduction"/NN in/IN immigration/NN he/PRP said/VBD although/IN he/PRP could/MD not/RB predict/VB a/DT figure./NN
He/PRP said/VBD that/IN only/RB two/CD out/IN of/IN 10/CD asylum/NN seekers/NNS had/VBD their/PRP$ claims/NNS accepted/VBD under/IN the/DT current/JJ "unfair/NN and/CC inhumane"/NN system./NN

"We/NN need/VBP to/TO break/VB the/DT link/NN between/IN arriving/VBG in/IN Britain/NNP and/CC claiming/VBG asylum"/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said./NN
"By/NN breaking/VBG that/WDT link/NN we/PRP can/MD smash/VB the/DT criminal/JJ gangs/NNS at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT trade/NN in/IN people/NNS smuggling."/VBP

But/CC the/DT UN/NNP refugees/NNS agency/NN is/VBZ worried/VBN the/DT policy/NN sends/VBZ the/DT wrong/JJ message/NN to/TO poorer/JJR countries/NNS which/WDT receive/VBP the/DT bulk/NN of/IN refugees./NN
And/CC a/DT spokesman/NN for/IN European/NNP Justice/NNP and/CC Home/NNP Affairs/NNP Commissioner/NNP Franco/NNP Frattini/NNP said/VBD the/DT plans/NNS would/MD contravene/VB EU/NNP asylum/NN policy/NN which/WDT meant/VBD the/DT UK/NNP could/MD not/RB simply/RB refuse/VB to/TO hear/VB an/DT asylum/NN case./NN
Refugee/NNP Council/NNP Chief/NNP Executive/NNP Maeve/NNP Sherlock/NNP called/VBD the/DT plans/NNS "dangerous/JJ ill/JJ thought-out/JJ and/CC hugely/RB irresponsible"./NN
Lives/NNS could/MD be/VB put/VBN at/IN risk/NN if/IN refugees/NNS were/VBD turned/VBN away/RB once/RB the/DT quotas/NNS were/VBD filled/VBN she/PRP warned./VBP
Commission/NNP for/IN Racial/JJ Equality/NN chairman/NN Trevor/NNP Phillips/NNP said/VBD asylum/NN applications/NNS were/VBD down/RB 40%/CD and/CC economic/JJ migration/NN down/RP about/IN 10%./CD

He/PRP did/VBD not/RB think/VB Mr/NNP Howard/NNP intended/VBD to/TO centre/VB the/DT debate/NN about/IN race./NN
But/CC he/PRP warned/VBD that/IN some/DT campaigners/NNS could/MD use/VB his/PRP$ words/NNS to/TO hint/VB the/DT policy/NN was/VBD about/IN keeping/VBG out/RP people/NNS of/IN a/DT different/JJ colour/NN or/CC culture./NN
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP called/VBD that/DT suggestion/NN "disgraceful"./NN
