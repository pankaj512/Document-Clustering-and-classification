Turkey/NNP turns/VBZ on/IN the/DT economic/JJ charm/NN

Three/CD years/NNS after/IN a/DT gruelling/VBG economic/JJ crisis/NN Turkey/NNP has/VBZ dressed/VBN its/PRP$ economy/NN to/TO impress./VB

As/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT charm/NN offensive/JJ -/: ahead/RB of/IN 17/CD December/NNP when/WRB the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP will/MD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO start/VB entry/NN talks/NNS -/: Turkey's/NNP economic/JJ leaders/NNS have/VBP been/VBN banging/VBG the/DT drum/NN to/TO draw/VB attention/NN to/TO recent/JJ achievements./NN
The/DT economy/NN is/VBZ growing/VBG fast/RB they/PRP insist./VBP
Education/NN levels/NNS among/IN its/PRP$ young/JJ and/CC large/JJ population/NN are/VBP rising./NN
Unemployment/NN levels/NNS in/IN percentage/NN terms/NNS are/VBP heading/VBG fast/RB towards/IN single/JJ digits./NN
Inflation/NN is/VBZ under/IN control./NN
A/DT new/JJ law/NN to/TO govern/VB its/PRP$ turbulent/JJ banking/NN system/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT cards./NN
The/DT tourism/NN industry/NN is/VBZ booming/JJ and/CC revenues/NNS from/IN visitors/NNS should/MD more/RBR than/IN double/JJ to/TO $21bn/CD (£10.8bn)/CD in/IN three/CD years./NN

Moreover/RB government/NN spending/NN is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO be/VB frozen/JJ and/CC a/DT burdensome/JJ social/JJ security/NN deficit/NN is/VBZ being/VBG tackled./NN
Income/NNP and/CC corporate/JJ taxes/NNS will/MD be/VB cut/VBN next/JJ year/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO attract/VB $15bn/CD of/IN foreign/JJ investment/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD years./NN
A/DT loan/NN restructuring/NN deal/NN with/IN the/DT International/NNP Monetary/NNP Fund/NNP (IMF)/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB much/RB in/IN the/DT can./NN
And/CC following/VBG recent/JJ macroeconomic/JJ restructuring/NN efforts/VBZ its/PRP$ currency/NN is/VBZ floating/VBG freely/RB and/CC its/PRP$ central/JJ bank/NN is/VBZ independent./NN

The/DT point/NN of/IN all/PDT this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO convince/VB Europe's/NNP decision/NN makers/NNS that/IN rather/RB than/IN being/VBG a/DT phenomenally/RB costly/JJ exercise/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP allowing/VBG Turkey/NNP in/IN would/MD in/IN fact/NN bring/NN masses/NNS of/IN economic/JJ benefits./NN

"The/NN cake/NN will/MD be/VB bigger/JJR for/IN everybody"/NN said/VBD Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Abdullatif/NNP Sener/NNP earlier/RBR this/DT month./NN
"Turkey/NN will/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT burden/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP budget."/NN If/IN admitted/VBN into/IN the/DT EU/NNP Turkey/NNP would/MD contribute/VB almost/RB 6bn/CD euros/NNS ($8bn/CD £6bn)/CD to/TO its/PRP$ budget/NN by/IN 2014/CD according/VBG to/TO a/DT recent/JJ impact/NN study/NN by/IN the/DT country's/NNS State/NNP Planning/NNP Organisation./NNP
As/IN Turkey's/NNP gross/JJ domestic/JJ output/NN (GDP)/NN is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO grow/VB by/IN 6%/CD per/IN year/NN on/IN average/NN its/PRP$ contribution/NN would/MD rise/VB from/IN less/JJR than/IN 5bn/CD euros/NNS in/IN 2014/CD to/TO almost/RB 9bn/CD euros/NNS by/IN 2020./CD
Turkey/NNP could/MD also/RB help/VB alleviate/VB a/DT labour/NN shortage/NN in/IN "Old/NN Europe"/NNP once/RB its/PRP$ population/NN comes/VBZ of/IN age./NN
By/IN 2014/CD one/CD in/IN four/CD Turks/NNPS -/: or/CC about/IN 18/CD million/CD people/NNS -/: will/MD be/VB aged/VBN 14/CD or/CC less./NN
"A/NN literate/NN and/CC qualified/VBN Turkish/JJ population"/NN insisted/VBD Mr/NNP Sener/NNP "will/NN make/VB a/DT positive/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT EU."/NNP

This/DT runs/VBZ contrary/JJ to/TO the/DT popular/JJ view/NN that/IN Turkey/NNP is/VBZ getting/VBG ready/JJ to/TO dig/VB deep/JJ into/IN EU/NNP taxpayers'/NN wallets./NN
However/RB Turkey's/NNP assertions/NNS are/VBP confirmed/VBN by/IN Brussels'/NNP own/JJ impact/NN studies/NNS which/WDT indeed/RB say/VBP that/IN Turkish/JJ membership/NN would/MD be/VB good/JJ news/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP economy./NN
But/CC only/RB over/IN time./NN
Costs/NNS are/VBP projected/VBN to/TO be/VB vast/JJ during/IN the/DT early/JJ years/NNS of/IN Turkey's/NNP membership/NN with/IN subsidies/NNS alone/RB estimated/VBN to/TO exceed/VB 16.5bn/CD euros/NNS and/CC according/VBG to/TO some/DT predictions/NNS balloon/NN to/TO 33.5bn/CD euros./NN
This/DT would/MD include/VB vast/JJ agricultural/JJ subsidies/NNS and/CC regional/JJ aid/NN though/IN such/JJ payments/NNS should/MD decline/VB as/IN the/DT country's/NNS farm/NN sector/NN which/WDT currently/RB employs/VBZ one/CD in/IN three/CD Turks/NNPS would/MD employ/VB just/RB one/CD in/IN five/CD by/IN 2020./CD

Such/JJ high/JJ initial/JJ expenses/NNS would/MD be/VB coupled/VBN with/IN risks/NNS that/IN the/DT benefits/NNS flagged/VBD up/RP by/IN Turkey's/NNP government/NN would/MD never/RB be/VB delivered/VBN say/VBP those/DT who/WP feel/VBP the/DT Turkish/JJ project/NN should/MD be/VB shunned./NN

Some/DT fear/NN that/IN rather/RB than/IN providing/VBG an/DT educated/VBN sophisticated/JJ labour/NN force/NN for/IN Europe/NNP at/IN large/JJ the/DT people/NNS who/WP will/MD leave/VB Turkey/NNP to/TO seek/VB work/NN abroad/RB will/MD be/VB poor/JJ uneducated/JJ -/: and/CC plentiful./NN
More/RBR recently/RB less/RBR palatable/JJ concerns/NNS -/: at/IN least/JJS in/IN liberal/JJ European/JJ circles/NNS -/: have/VBP been/VBN voiced/VBN with/IN senior/JJ EU/NNP or/CC member/NN state/NN officials/NNS talking/VBG darkly/RB of/IN a/DT "river/NN of/IN Islam"/NNP an/DT "oriental"/NN culture/NN and/CC a/DT threat/NN to/TO Europe's/NNP "cultural/JJ richness"./NN
Of/IN course/NN many/JJ opponents/NNS are/VBP politically/RB motivated/VBN -/: their/PRP$ views/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN xenophobic/JJ prejudices/NNS about/IN the/DT country's/NNS Muslim/NNP traditions/NNS to/TO well-documented/JJ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT government's/NNS human/JJ rights/NNS record./NN
Yet/RB their/PRP$ economic/JJ arguments/NNS should/MD not/RB be/VB dismissed/VBN out/IN of/IN hand./NN

Critics/NNS insist/VBP that/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT optimism/NN about/IN Turkey's/NNP economic/JJ roadmap/NN has/VBZ been/VBN over-egged/JJ -/: an/DT argument/NN amplified/VBN by/IN a/DT 134%/CD rise/NN in/IN the/DT country's/NNS current/JJ account/NN deficit/NN to/TO $10.7bn/CD during/IN the/DT first/JJ 10/CD months/NNS of/IN this/DT year./NN

The/DT country's/NNS massive/JJ debt/NN -/: which/WDT includes/VBZ $23bn/CD owed/VBN to/TO the/DT IMF/NNP and/CC billions/NNS borrowed/VBN via/IN the/DT international/JJ bond/NN markets/NNS -/: also/RB remains/VBZ a/DT major/JJ obstacle/NN to/TO its/PRP$ ambition/NN of/IN joining/VBG the/DT EU./NNP
"In/NN the/DT new/JJ member/NN states/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP gross/JJ public/JJ debt/NN is/VBZ typically/RB about/IN 40%/CD of/IN gross/JJ domestic/JJ product"/NN says/VBZ Reza/NNP Moghadam/NNP assistant/JJ director/NN of/IN the/DT IMF's/JJ European/NNP Department./NNP
"At/NN about/IN 80%/CD of/IN GDP/NNP Turkey's/NNP gross/JJ debt/NN is/VBZ double/JJ that/DT figure."/NN Turkey's/NNP debts/NNS have/VBP largely/RB arisen/VBN from/IN its/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO push/VB through/IN banking/NN reform/NN after/IN a/DT run/NN on/IN the/DT banks/NNS in/IN 2001/CD caused/VBD the/DT country's/NNS devastating/JJ recession./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ no/DT question/NN that/IN although/IN Turkey/NNP is/VBZ doing/VBG much/RB better/JJR than/IN in/IN the/DT past/JJ it/PRP remains/VBZ quite/RB vulnerable"/NN says/VBZ Michael/NNP Deppler/NNP director/NN of/IN the/DT IMF's/JJ European/NNP Department./NNP
"Its/NN debt/NN is/VBZ far/RB too/RB high/JJ for/IN an/DT emerging/VBG economy."/NN A/DT key/JJ factor/NN for/IN EU/NNP decision/NN makers/NNS should/MD be/VB whether/IN or/CC not/RB Turkey/NNP has/VBZ met/VBN its/PRP$ economic/JJ criteria./NN
But/CC economics/NNS is/VBZ not/RB a/DT science./NN
And/CC although/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN Turkey's/NNP economy/NN is/VBZ important/JJ as/IN is/VBZ its/PRP$ pace/NN of/IN reform/NN the/DT final/JJ decision/NN on/IN 17/CD December/NNP will/MD be/VB taken/VBN by/IN politicians/NNS who/WP will/MD of/IN course/NN be/VB guided/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ political/JJ instincts./NN
