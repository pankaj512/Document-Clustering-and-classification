"Playing/VBG three/CD up/RP was/VBD something/NN different./NN
Brian/NNP Kerr/NNP wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB it/PRP out/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ to/TO see/VB young/JJ Stephen/NNP Elliott/NNP getting/VBG a/DT run-out./JJ
"The/NN conditions/NNS were/VBD difficult/JJ but/CC he/PRP did/VBD well/RB and/CC is/VBZ definitely/RB one/CD for/IN the/DT future./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ nice/JJ to/TO see/VB young/JJ players/NNS coming/VBG through."/NN Man-of-the-match/NNP Duff/NNP explained/VBD what/WP went/VBD wrong/JJ when/WRB he/PRP fluffed/VBD a/DT chance/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP 2-0/JJ midway/NN through/IN the/DT second/JJ half./NN
He/PRP opted/VBD to/TO bring/VB Steve/NNP Finnan's/NNP cross/VB down/RP and/CC shoot/VB against/IN the/DT bar/NN when/WRB a/DT close-range/JJ header/NN looked/VBD the/DT best/JJS option./NN
"I/NN would/MD have/VB headed/VBN that/IN every/DT time/NN but/CC I/PRP completely/RB lost/VBD it/PRP in/IN the/DT lights"/NN said/VBD the/DT Chelsea/NNP star./NN
"I/NN was/VBD desperate/JJ to/TO get/VB on/IN the/DT scoresheet/NN myself/PRP but/CC the/DT result/NN is/VBZ the/DT important/JJ thing./NN

Hopefully/RB that/WDT can/MD continue/VB in/IN 2005."/CD
