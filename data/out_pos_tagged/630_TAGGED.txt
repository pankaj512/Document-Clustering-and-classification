To/TO mark/VB the/DT 60th/JJ anniversary/NN of/IN the/DT birth/NN of/IN reggae/NN star/NN Bob/NNP Marley/NNP Rob/NNP Partridge/NNP -/: Marley's/NNP former/JJ head/NN of/IN press/NN at/IN Island/NNP Records/NNPS -/: remembers/VBZ the/DT man/NN behind/IN the/DT legend./NN

Partridge/NNP worked/VBD with/IN Marley/NNP from/IN 1977/CD until/IN the/DT Jamaican/JJ musician's/NNS death/NN in/IN 1981./CD

"I/NN joined/VBD Island/NNP Records/NNPS in/IN 1977/CD and/CC the/DT first/JJ week/NN I/PRP was/VBD there/EX I/PRP worked/VBD on/IN his/PRP$ show/NN at/IN the/DT Rainbow/NNP Theatre./NNP
It/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT last/JJ dates/NNS he/PRP did/VBD in/IN London."/NNP

The/DT album/NN Exodus/NNP came/VBD out/RP in/IN 1977/CD and/CC that/WDT provided/VBN five/CD hits/NNS and/CC confirmed/VBD his/PRP$ global/JJ superstar/NN status./NN
"By/NN 1979/CD he/PRP was/VBD the/DT biggest/JJS touring/VBG attraction/NN in/IN the/DT world./NN
I/PRP remember/VBP going/VBG to/TO see/VB dates/NNS in/IN Milan/NNP and/CC Turin/NNP and/CC they/PRP were/VBD enormous/JJ concerts."/NN

Bob/NNP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS mesmeric/JJ people/NNS I've/NNP ever/RB had/VBD the/DT privilege/NN to/TO work/VB with./NN
"He/NN must/MD have/VB had/VBN an/DT iron/NN will/MD to/TO succeed./VB
Bob/NNP was/VBD a/DT very/RB driven/VBN individual./NN
You/PRP realised/VBD from/IN the/DT start/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT manifest/JJ destiny/NN within/IN him/PRP that/IN he/PRP believed/VBD in./NN
He/PRP didn't/VBP suffer/NN fools/NNS gladly./NN
At/IN the/DT risk/NN of/IN stating/VBG the/DT obvious/JJ he/PRP was/VBD an/DT extraordinary/JJ song/NN writer/NN and/CC his/PRP$ stage/NN act/NN was/VBD perhaps/RB the/DT greatest/JJS I've/NNP ever/RB seen./NN
I/PRP saw/VBD him/PRP many/JJ times."/NN

"I/NN recall/NN in/IN 1978/CD he/PRP came/VBD to/TO the/DT UK/NNP for/IN Top/JJ of/IN the/DT Pops/NNS and/CC a/DT Daily/NNP Mirror/NNP journalist/NN did/VBD a/DT half-hour/NN interview./JJ
It/PRP was/VBD interrupted/VBN to/TO do/VB a/DT rehearsal./NN
He/PRP came/VBD back/RB into/IN the/DT dressing/VBG room/NN to/TO resume/VB the/DT interview/NN but/CC saw/VBD a/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP match/VB on/IN TV./NNP

"He/NN sat/VBD down/RB in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT TV/NN and/CC after/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS it/PRP was/VBD obvious/JJ he/PRP wasn't/VB going/VBG to/TO move./VB
That/DT was/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN it./NN
The/DT Mirror/NNP had/VBD a/DT very/RB truncated/VBN interview./JJ
"The/NN last/JJ time/NN I/PRP saw/VBD him/PRP was/VBD in/IN London/NNP in/IN 1980./CD
I/PRP arranged/VBD for/IN him/PRP to/TO play/VB four/CD days/NNS of/IN football/NN indoors/NNS in/IN Fulham./NNP
"Bob/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ player./NN
We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN Jamaican-style/JJ football./NN
He/PRP was/VBD an/DT attacking/VBG midfield/NN player./NN
His/PRP$ team/NN assembled/VBN wherever/WRB his/PRP$ gigs/NNS were./NN
We/PRP played/VBD in/IN Brazil/NNP against/IN some/DT World/NNP Cup-winning/NNP players."/NN

It/PRP was/VBD always/RB a/DT struggle/NN for/IN him/PRP to/TO connect/VB with/IN Black/NNP America./NNP
Reggae/NNP did/VBD not/RB correspond/VB with/IN disco/NN in/IN the/DT 70s./CD
But/CC Bob/NNP in/IN the/DT 1990s/CD became/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT great/JJ icons/NNS in/IN America/NNP and/CC the/DT Third/NNP World./NNP
"In/NN 1991/CD ten/NN years/NNS after/IN his/PRP$ death/NN he/PRP sold/VBD more/JJR records/NNS than/IN at/IN any/DT time/NN during/IN his/PRP$ life./NN
"We/NN saw/VBD Black/NNP America/NNP taking/VBG Bob/NNP into/IN their/PRP$ hearts/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time."/NN

"Bob/NN in/IN worldwide/NN terms/NNS is/VBZ the/DT greatest/JJS music/NN star/NN there/EX has/VBZ ever/RB been./NN
If/IN you/PRP went/VBD to/TO Africa/NNP he/PRP would/MD be/VB recognised/VBN everywhere/RB in/IN places/NNS John/NNP Lennon/NNP or/CC Elvis/NNP wouldn't/NN be./NN
"No/NN disrespect/JJ to/TO the/DT other/JJ artists/NNS but/CC a/DT case/NN can/MD be/VB made/VBN for/IN him/PRP as/IN the/DT greatest/JJS the/DT best/JJS and/CC the/DT most/RBS influential/JJ artist/NN in/IN popular/JJ music."/NN

Well/RB 1981/CD was/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT year/NN he/PRP toured/VBD Africa/NNP with/IN Stevie/NNP Wonder./NNP
He/PRP had/VBD only/RB performed/VBN in/IN Zimbabwe/NNP and/CC Guinea/NNP before./NN
"Of/NN course/NN the/DT 1981/CD tour/NN never/RB happened/VBD but/CC the/DT whole/NN of/IN Africa/NNP would/MD have/VB embraced/VBN him./NN
We/PRP can't/VBP speculate/NN but/CC he/PRP was/VBD at/IN the/DT height/NN of/IN his/PRP$ powers/NNS and/CC just/RB 36/CD years/NNS old./NN
I/PRP had/VBD no/DT sense/NN his/PRP$ career/NN was/VBD going/VBG to/TO go/VB downhill."/NN

"Bob/NN was/VBD endlessly/RB optimistic/JJ about/IN the/DT way/NN Africa/NNP would/MD turn/VB out./NN
He/PRP realised/VBD that/IN nothing/NN was/VBD perfect/JJ but/CC he/PRP had/VBD total/JJ belief/NN in/IN the/DT power/NN of/IN mankind./NN
"I'm/NN sure/JJ if/IN he/PRP were/VBD alive/JJ today/NN he/PRP would/MD believe/VB Africa/NNP would/MD firstly/RB become/VB politically/RB free/JJ and/CC secondly/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO defeat/VB the/DT Aids/NNS epidemic."/NN

"The/NN final/JJ tune/NN of/IN his/PRP$ final/JJ album/NN was/VBD Redemption/NN Song/NN -/: one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS incredible/JJ classics/NNS of/IN all/DT time."/NN
