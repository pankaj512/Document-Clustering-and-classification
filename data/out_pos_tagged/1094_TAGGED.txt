However/RB Norfolk/NNP police/NN chief/NN Andy/NNP Hayman/NNP also/RB warned/VBD that/IN a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN preparatory/NN work/NN was/VBD still/RB needed./NN
"I/NN don't/NN subscribe/NN to/TO the/DT views/NNS of/IN some/DT of/IN my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS who/WP are/VBP coming/VBG out/RB and/CC objecting/VBG to/TO it"/VB he/PRP said./VB

However/RB Mr/NNP Hayman/NNP said/VBD "It/NN would/MD be/VB totally/RB unacceptable/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ view/NN for/IN a/DT chief/JJ constable/JJ to/TO say/VB 'I'm/NN very/RB sorry'./NN
He/PRP said/VBD that/DT police/NN should/MD make/VB sure/JJ that/IN responsible/JJ people/NNS who/WP wanted/VBD a/DT change/NN could/MD benefit/VB from/IN more/RBR liberal/JJ legislation./NN
"My/NN view/NN is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP have/VBP got/VBN a/DT responsibility/NN to/TO create/VB an/DT environment/NN where/WRB that/WDT can/MD happen/VB ''/'' he/PRP said./VB
However/RB he/PRP believes/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN preparatory/NN work/NN is/VBZ still/RB needed/VBN to/TO be/VB done/VBN by/IN police/NN local/JJ authorities/NNS and/CC the/DT drinks/NNS industry/NN before/IN the/DT nation/NN was/VBD ready/JJ for/IN 24-hour/JJ drinking./NN

But/CC aspects/NNS such/JJ as/IN transport/NN and/CC basic/JJ things/NNS such/JJ as/IN making/VBG sure/JJ public/JJ toilets/NNS are/VBP open/JJ all/DT night/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB taken/VBN into/IN account./NN

Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Tony/NNP Blair/NNP has/VBZ defended/VBN the/DT Licensing/NNP Act/NNP saying/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ wrong/JJ to/TO deny/VB people/NNS the/DT relaxed/VBN hours/NNS enjoyed/VBN elsewhere/RB in/IN Europe/NNP because/IN of/IN a/DT "tiny/NN minority"/NN of/IN violent/JJ binge/NN drinkers./NN
A/DT six-month/JJ transitional/JJ period/NN starts/VBZ on/IN 7/CD February/NNP during/IN which/WDT time/NN venues/NNS can/MD apply/VB for/IN extended/JJ licences./NN
The/DT Conservatives/NNS have/VBP called/VBN for/IN 24-hour/JJ drinking/NN to/TO be/VB shelved/JJ until/IN the/DT problems/NNS of/IN binge/NN drinking/NN are/VBP solved./NN
On/IN Monday/NNP the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP also/RB called/VBD for/IN a/DT delay./NN
Lib/NNP Dem/NNP Home/NNP Affairs/NNP spokesman/NN Mark/NNP Oaten/NNP said/VBD "It/NN would/MD clearly/RB be/VB prudent/JJ to/TO allow/VB the/DT police/NN and/CC local/JJ authorities/NNS more/JJR time/NN to/TO prepare/VB for/IN flexible/JJ drinking/NN hours."/NN Chief/NNP constable/JJ Mr/NNP Hayman/NNP acknowledged/VBD that/DT binge/NN drinking/NN did/VBD cause/VB problems./NN
"If/NN you/PRP come/VBP to/TO Norwich/NNP on/IN a/DT Friday/NNP or/CC Saturday/NNP night/NN you/PRP will/MD see/VB things/NNS going/VBG on/IN that/WDT will/MD you/PRP make/VB you/PRP feel/VB ashamed./NN
"However/NN I/PRP want/VBP industry/NN to/TO succeed/VB in/IN Norwich/NNP and/CC I/PRP want/VBP Norwich/NNP to/TO be/VB the/DT recognised/VBN nightspot/NN of/IN East/NNP Anglia./NNP
"There/NN is/VBZ no/DT way/NN I/PRP want/VBP to/TO say/VB we/PRP cannot/VBP manage/NN it/PRP or/CC police/NN it./NN
We/PRP can."/VBP
