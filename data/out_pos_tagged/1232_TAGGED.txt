Labour's/NNP core/NN support/NN takes/VBZ stock/NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP has/VBZ told/VBN Labour/NNP supporters/NNS he's/NNS "back"/NN and/CC still/RB hungry/JJ for/IN the/DT job/NN of/IN prime/JJ minister/NN -/: but/CC does/VBZ that/DT sum/NN up/RP the/DT mood/NN at/IN the/DT party's/NNS spring/NN conference/NN in/IN Gateshead?/NNP

"The/NN electorate/NN are/VBP keener/NN on/IN the/DT government/NN than/IN some/DT Labour/NNP Party/NNP members"/NN is/VBZ the/DT dry/JJ assessment/NN of/IN Graham/NNP Lane/NNP leader/NN of/IN the/DT Labour/NNP group/NN on/IN Newham/NNP Council./NNP
The/DT problem/NN according/VBG to/TO Mr/NNP Lane/NNP is/VBZ not/RB continuing/VBG divisions/NNS over/IN Iraq/NNP foundation/NN hospitals/NNS or/CC tuition/NN fees/NNS or/CC even/RB voter/NN apathy/NN but/CC Mr/NNP Blair/NNP himself./NN
"I/NN have/VBP a/DT new/JJ slogan./NN
Vote/NNP Blair/NNP Get/VB Brown./NNP
That's/NNP what/WP I/PRP am/VBP telling/VBG people/NNS on/IN the/DT doorstep./NN
Don't/NNS worry/VBP he/PRP will/MD be/VB gone/VBN soon."/NN His/PRP$ friend/NN Saxon/NNP Spence/NNP leader/NN of/IN Devon/NNP county/NN Labour/NNP group/NN lays/VBZ the/DT blame/NN for/IN any/DT lack/NN of/IN campaigning/NN zeal/JJ on/IN one/CD issue/NN above/IN all/DT others./NN
"You/NN cannot/NN underestimate/NN the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN in/IN Iraq./NNP
We/PRP lost/VBD people/NNS from/IN our/PRP$ local/JJ party/NN who/WP had/VBD some/DT key/JJ roles."/NN

But/CC the/DT two/CD friends/NNS were/VBD fired/VBN up/RP by/IN Gordon/NNP Brown's/NNP speech/NN on/IN Saturday/NNP with/IN its/PRP$ appeal/NN to/TO core/VB Labour/NNP values/NNS on/IN social/JJ justice/NN health/NN and/CC education./NN

"There/NN was/VBD real/JJ passion./NN
I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP all/DT felt/VBN a/DT little/JJ jaded/VBN but/CC it/PRP reminded/VBD us/PRP why/WRB we/PRP joined/VBD the/DT party/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place"/NN said/VBD Mrs/NNP Spence./NNP
"If/NN he/PRP hadn't/VB have/VBP walked/VBN off/RP the/DT stage/NN they/PRP would/MD still/RB be/VB clapping"/NN added/VBN Mr/NNP Lane./NNP
But/CC for/IN every/DT Brownite/NNP at/IN the/DT spring/NN conference/NN there/EX was/VBD an/DT equally/RB ardent/JJ fan/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Blair./NNP
Stephen/NNP Douglas/NNP 26/CD from/IN Wales/NNP said/VBD after/IN the/DT PM's/NNP speech/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP "I/NN think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT turning/NN point/NN given/VBN the/DT roasting/VBG he/PRP has/VBZ had/VBN on/IN some/DT issues./NN
The/DT guy/NN still/RB has/VBZ it."/NN

Tony/NNP Martin/NNP of/IN Burnley/NNP said/VBD "He/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ leader/NN who/WP has/VBZ won/VBN us/PRP two/CD terms./NN
This/DT bloke/NN has/VBZ delivered/VBN for/IN us."/NN Malcolm/NNP Shipley/NNP of/IN Shipley/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD "as/NN if/IN he/PRP is/VBZ coming/VBG round/NN to/TO the/DT right/JJ approach/NN again"./NN
Katrina/NNP Bull/NNP a/DT prospective/JJ parliamentary/JJ candidate/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Blair/NNP had/VBD shown/VBN he/PRP could/MD rouse/VB the/DT party's/NNS grassroots/NNS "I/NN think/VBP if/IN every/DT voter/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO spend/VB time/NN in/IN a/DT room/NN with/IN Tony/NNP the/DT way/NN we/PRP have/VBP today/NN we/PRP will/MD have/VB no/DT problem/NN with/IN turnout."/NN She/PRP had/VBD just/RB emerged/VBN from/IN a/DT Q&A/NNP session/NN in/IN which/WDT Mr/NNP Blair/NNP -/: tieless/JJ and/CC supremely/RB at/IN ease/NN -/: answered/VBN questions/NNS posed/VBN via/IN the/DT party's/NNS website./NN

A/DT party/NN of/IN councillors/NNS from/IN Nottingham/NNP agreed/VBD that/IN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN wrong/JJ with/IN Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP leadership/NN -/: and/CC they/PRP were/VBD adamant/JJ that/IN the/DT campaigning/NN strength/NN of/IN the/DT party/NN in/IN their/PRP$ city/NN was/VBD as/RB strong/JJ as/IN ever./NN
Iraq/NNP they/PRP insisted/VBD would/MD not/RB be/VB a/DT factor/NN for/IN most/JJS voters./NN
"The/NN biggest/JJS problem/NN we/PRP have/VBP got/VBN at/IN the/DT moment/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP keep/VBP getting/VBG all/PDT these/DT polls/NNS saying/VBG we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO run/VB away/RB with/IN the/DT election./NN
"It/NN might/MD sound/VB great/JJ but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ create/VB this/DT sense/NN of/IN complacency/NN among/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ voters/NNS and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/DT is/VBZ the/DT greater/JJR problem/NN than/IN Iraq"/NNP said/VBD Nottingham/NNP City/NNP Councillor/NNP Brian/NNP Parbutt./NNP
And/CC even/RB Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP most/RBS vocal/JJ critics/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO agree/VB on/IN one/CD thing/NN -/: he/PRP is/VBZ a/DT master/NN of/IN the/DT sort/NN of/IN glossy/JJ high-profile/JJ campaigning/NN that/WDT has/VBZ become/VBN Labour's/NNP hallmark/NN epitomised/VBN by/IN Friday's/NNP whistle-stop/JJ tour/NN of/IN marginal/JJ seats./NN
A/DT group/NN of/IN shop/NN stewards/NNS from/IN the/DT Swan/NN Hunter/NNP shipyard/NN who/WP said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD facing/VBG redundancy/NN could/MD barely/RB suppress/VB their/PRP$ anger/NN at/IN Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP failure/NN to/TO as/IN they/PRP saw/VBD it/PRP shake/VB off/RP his/PRP$ Tory/NNP leanings/NNS and/CC stand/VBP up/RP for/IN manufacturing/NN in/IN the/DT North/NNP East./NNP

They/PRP were/VBD also/RB scathing/JJ about/IN the/DT alleged/VBN benefits/NNS of/IN showpiece/NN projects/NNS such/JJ as/IN conference/NN venue/NN Sage/NN Centre/NNP heralded/VBD by/IN John/NNP Prescott/NNP and/CC others/NNS this/DT weekend/NN as/IN a/DT symbol/NN of/IN Labour's/NNP success/NN in/IN urban/JJ regeneration./NN

"It/NN is/VBZ no/DT good/JJ having/NN the/DT Sage/NN or/CC Baltic/JJ if/IN you/PRP haven't/VBP got/VBD the/DT money/NN for/IN the/DT entrance/NN fee"/NN said/VBD Terry/NNP Telford./NNP
But/CC when/WRB asked/VBD about/IN Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP bravura/NN performance/NN on/IN Friday/NNP the/DT men/NNS agreed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD "brilliant"./NN
And/CC they/PRP would/MD all/DT be/VB out/RP on/IN the/DT doorstep/NN pushing/VBG the/DT Labour/NNP message/NN come/VBN election/NN time./NN
"If/NN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB fired/VBN up/RP about/IN the/DT election/NN then/RB what's/VBZ the/DT point?/NN There/EX is/VBZ no/DT complacency/NN as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP can/MD see/VB in/IN the/DT Labour/NNP Party./NNP
We/PRP are/VBP fired/VBN up./NN
We/PRP are/VBP up/IN for/IN this/DT election"/NN said/VBD Richie/NNP Porterhouse./NNP
Mr/NNP Telford/NNP agreed/VBD but/CC added/VBD it/PRP was/VBD becoming/VBG increasingly/RB difficult/JJ to/TO think/VB of/IN an/DT answer/NN when/WRB people/NNS asked/VBD "What/NN has/VBZ Labour/NNP done/VBD for/IN the/DT North/NNP East?"/NNP "I/NN have/VBP had/VBN doors/NNS slammed/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ face"/NN he/PRP said./VB

Every/DT activist/NN I/PRP spoke/VBD to/TO said/VB they/PRP were/VBD proud/JJ of/IN what/WP they/PRP believed/VBD Labour/NNP had/VBD achieved/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ local/JJ communities/NNS -/: the/DT new/JJ hospitals/NNS and/CC schools/VBZ the/DT better/JJR life/NN chances/NNS for/IN young/JJ people./NN
The/DT problem/NN they/PRP faced/VBD they/PRP said/VBD was/VBD converting/VBG this/DT local/JJ feelgood/NN factor/NN into/IN votes./NN
But/CC they/PRP could/MD at/IN least/JJS rely/VB on/IN one/CD "secret/NN weapon"/NN as/IN one/CD activist/NN put/VBD it/PRP -/: Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard./NNP
