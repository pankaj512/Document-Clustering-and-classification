"Do/NN you/PRP have/VBP it/PRP in/IN your/PRP$ heart?/NN How/WRB much/JJ guts/NNS do/VBP you/PRP have?/VBP How/WRB much/JJ do/VBP you/PRP hate/VB to/TO lose?"/VB

These/DT are/VBP the/DT questions/NNS Jimmy/NNP Connors/NNP will/MD be/VB asking/NN of/IN Britain's/NNP brightest/JJS tennis/NN hopes/NNS in/IN the/DT months/NNS and/CC possibly/RB years/NNS to/TO come./VB

But/CC Connors/NNP is/VBZ at/IN pains/NNS to/TO point/VB out/RP that/IN his/PRP$ interest/NN goes/VBZ well/RB beyond/IN any/DT publicity/NN stunt/NN and/CC he/PRP gave/VBD a/DT glowing/JJ recommendation/NN to/TO the/DT work/NN of/IN LTA/NNP performance/NN director/NN David/NNP Felgate/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ team./NN
"Britain/NN has/VBZ a/DT different/JJ attitude/NN the/DT right/JJ attitude/NN in/IN taking/VBG the/DT game/NN forward/RB and/CC finding/VBG the/DT next/JJ Wimbledon/NNP champion"/NN said/VBD Connors./NNP
"That's/NN something/NN you/PRP don't/VBP find/VB every/DT day./NN
Everybody/NN talks/NNS a/DT good/JJ game/NN but/CC not/RB everybody/NN puts/VBZ that/IN into/IN effect./NN
"The/NN impression/NN I/PRP came/VBD away/RB with/IN after/IN just/RB seeing/VBG David/NNP and/CC the/DT other/JJ coaches/NNS for/IN three/CD days/NNS was/VBD one/CD like/IN I've/NNP never/RB seen/VBD before/IN especially/RB over/IN here./NN
"This/NN is/VBZ not/RB going/VBG to/TO happen/VB overnight/JJ there/EX are/VBP no/DT miracle/NN workers/NNS but/CC you're/NN going/VBG in/IN the/DT right/JJ direction."/NN The/DT 52-year-old's/JJ enthusiasm/NN for/IN the/DT work/NN going/VBG on/RP in/IN this/DT country/NN is/VBZ in/IN marked/VBN contrast/NN to/TO his/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN tennis/NN officials/NNS back/RB in/IN America./NNP
"I've/NN had/VBD discussions/NNS with/IN the/DT USTA/NNP (United/VBD States/NNPS Tennis/NN Association)/NNP over/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN years"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"That's/NN where/WRB it/PRP (my/VBD input)/NN ended."/NN Connors/NNP is/VBZ a/DT straight-talker/JJ and/CC will/MD be/VB equally/RB blunt/VB and/CC honest/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ dealings/NNS with/IN the/DT LTA/NNP and/CC the/DT cream/NN of/IN Britain's/NNP young/JJ players./NN

"If/NN not/RB someone/NN will/MD come/VB and/CC take/VB their/PRP$ place./NN
There's/NNP only/RB one/CD number/NN one/CD spot/NN and/CC it's/NNS lonely/JJ up/RP there/RB but/CC it's/NNS got/VBD the/DT best/JJS view."/NN In/IN the/DT year/NN that/WDT has/VBZ seen/VBN Andrew/NNP Murray/NNP emerge/VB as/IN Britain's/NNP great/JJ new/JJ hope/NN Connors/NNP rejected/VBD suggestions/NNS that/IN the/DT Scot/NNP might/MD be/VB put/VBN under/IN too/RB much/JJ pressure/NN too/RB soon./NN
"Tim/NNP Henman/NNP has/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ country/NN on/IN his/PRP$ shoulder"/NN said/VBD Connors./NNP
"I/NN don't/NN know/NN that/DT pressure/NN but/CC if/IN you/PRP like/IN that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB a/DT certain/JJ push/NN to/TO get/VB on/RP to/TO the/DT next/JJ level./NN
"Someone's/NN going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO come/VB and/CC take/VB over/RP from/IN him/PRP (Henman)./VB
If/IN I/PRP was/VBD Andrew/NNP Murray/NNP I'd/NNP embrace/VB that./NN
That's/NNP what/WP we/PRP play/VBP for."/NN Despite/IN the/DT emphasis/NN on/IN hard/JJ work/NN training/NN and/CC preparation/NN Connors/NNP does/VBZ admit/VB that/IN the/DT desire/NN required/VBN of/IN a/DT champion/NN has/VBZ to/TO come/VB from/IN within./NN
"The/NN passion/NN I/PRP had/VBD I/PRP don't/VBP know/NN if/IN you/PRP can/MD find/VB that"/NN he/PRP admitted./VB
"I/NN was/VBD also/RB nuts./NN
I/PRP say/VBP that/IN because/IN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN better/RBR for/IN me/PRP than/IN to/TO compete/VB on/IN the/DT tennis/NN court./NN
"It/NN was/VBD the/DT most/RBS important/JJ thing/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN for/IN me/PRP and/CC to/TO do/VB that/DT something's/NNS got/VBD to/TO be/VB not/RB right/NN with/IN you./NN

"What/NN I/PRP had/VBD when/WRB I/PRP played/VBD tennis/NN is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP am./VBP
