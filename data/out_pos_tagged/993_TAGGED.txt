"Deportation/NN may/MD tackle/VB this/DT initial/JJ problem/NN but/CC I/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB a/DT wider/JJR debate/NN urgently/RB about/IN how/WRB we/PRP can/MD actually/RB get/VB trials/NNS and/CC convictions/NNS in/IN this/DT country."/NN "Unless/NN we/PRP get/VBP that/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS will/MD vote/VB against/IN this/DT measure/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ for/IN renewal/NN in/IN March."/NNP
