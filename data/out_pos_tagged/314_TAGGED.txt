Yukos/NNP unit/NN fetches/VBZ $9bn/CD at/IN auction/NN

A/DT little-known/JJ Russian/JJ company/NN has/VBZ bought/VBN the/DT main/JJ production/NN unit/NN of/IN oil/NN giant/NN Yukos/NNP at/IN auction/NN in/IN Moscow./NNP

Baikal/NNP Finance/NNP Group/NNP outbid/VB favourite/NN Gazprom/NNP the/DT state-controlled/JJ gas/NN monopoly/NN to/TO buy/VB Yuganskneftegas./NNP
Baikal/NNP paid/VBD 260.75bn/CD roubles/NNS ($9.37bn/CD Â£4.8bn)/CD for/IN Yugansk/NNP -/: nowhere/RB near/IN the/DT $27bn/CD Russia/NNP says/VBZ Yukos/NNP owes/VBZ in/IN taxes./NN
Yukos/NNP reacted/VBD immediately/RB by/IN repeating/VBG its/PRP$ view/NN that/IN the/DT auction/NN was/VBD illegal/JJ in/IN international/JJ and/CC Russian/JJ law/NN and/CC said/VBD Baikal/NNP had/VBD bought/VBN itself/PRP trouble./VBP

"The/NN company/NN considers/VBZ that/IN the/DT victor/NN of/IN today's/NNS auction/NN has/VBZ bought/VBN itself/PRP a/DT serious/JJ $9bn/CD headache"/NN said/VBD Yukos/NNP spokesman/NN Alexander/NNP Shadrin./NNP
He/PRP said/VBD the/DT company/NN would/MD continue/VB to/TO make/VB "every/NN lawful/JJ move"/NN to/TO protect/VB tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN shareholders/NNS in/IN Yukos/NNP from/IN "this/NN forcible/JJ and/CC illegitimate/JJ removal/NN of/IN their/PRP$ property"./NN
Meanwhile/RB Tim/NNP Osborne/NNP head/NN of/IN Yukos/NNP main/JJ shareholders'/NN group/NN Menatep/NNP said/VBD that/IN Yukos/NNP may/MD have/VB to/TO declare/VB itself/PRP bankrupt/JJ and/CC that/IN legal/JJ action/NN would/MD be/VB taken/VBN outside/IN Russia/NNP against/IN the/DT auction/NN winners./NN
Reports/NNS from/IN Russia/NNP say/VBP Baikal/NNP has/VBZ paid/VBN a/DT deposit/NN of/IN nearly/RB $1.7bn/CD from/IN a/DT Sberbank/NNP (Savings/NN Bank)/NNP account/NN to/TO the/DT Russian/JJ Federal/NNP Property/NNP Fund/NNP for/IN Yugansk./NNP

The/DT sale/NN came/VBD despite/IN a/DT restraining/VBG order/NN issued/VBN by/IN a/DT US/PRP court/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT firm's/NNS bankruptcy/NN application/NN for/IN Chapter/NN 11/CD protection./NN
Yukos/NNP has/VBZ always/RB insisted/VBN the/DT auction/NN was/VBD state-sponsored/JJ theft/NN but/CC Russian/JJ authorities/NNS argued/VBD they/PRP were/VBD imposing/VBG the/DT law/NN trying/VBG to/TO recover/VB billions/NNS in/IN unpaid/JJ taxes./NN
There/EX were/VBD originally/RB four/CD registered/VBN bidders/NNS and/CC with/IN its/PRP$ close/NN ties/NNS to/TO the/DT Kremlin/NNP state-backed/JJ gas/NN monopoly/NN Gazprom/NNP had/VBD been/VBN seen/VBN as/IN favourite./NN
But/CC just/RB two/CD companies/NNS turned/VBD up/RP for/IN the/DT auction/NN Gazprom/NNP and/CC the/DT unknown/JJ Baikal/NNP Finance/NNP Group/NNP named/VBD after/IN a/DT large/JJ freshwater/NN lake/NN in/IN Siberia./NNP
And/CC according/VBG to/TO Tass/NNP news/NN agency/NN Gazprom/NNP did/VBD not/RB make/VB a/DT single/JJ bid/NN leaving/VBG the/DT way/NN open/JJ for/IN Baikal/NNP which/WDT paid/VBD above/IN the/DT auction/NN start/NN price/NN of/IN 246.75bn/CD roubles./NN

Mystery/NN firm/NN Baikal/NNP Finance/NNP Group/NNP is/VBZ officially/RB registered/VBN in/IN the/DT central/JJ Russian/JJ region/NN of/IN Tver/NNP but/CC many/JJ analysts/NNS believe/VBP it/PRP may/MD be/VB linked/VBN to/TO Gazprom./NNP
Kaha/NNP Kiknavelidze/NNP analyst/NN at/IN Troika/NNP Dialog/NNP said/VBD "I/NN think/VBP a/DT decision/NN that/IN Yugansk/NNP should/MD end/VB up/RP with/IN Gazprom/NNP was/VBD taken/VBN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ago./NN
So/IN the/DT main/JJ question/NN was/VBD how/WRB to/TO structure/VB this/DT transaction./NN

"I/NN would/MD not/RB exclude/VB that/IN the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT deal/NN has/VBZ slightly/RB changed/VBN and/CC Gazprom/NNP now/RB has/VBZ a/DT partner./NN
"I/NN would/MD also/RB not/RB exclude/VB that/IN Baikal/NNP will/MD decline/VB to/TO pay/VB in/IN 14/CD days/NNS that/WDT are/VBP given/VBN by/IN law/NN and/CC Gazprom/NNP is/VBZ then/RB recognised/VBN as/IN the/DT winner./NN
This/DT would/MD give/VB Gazprom/NNP an/DT extra/JJ 14/CD days/NNS to/TO accumulate/VB the/DT needed/VBN funds./NN
"Another/NN surprise/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT winner/NN paid/VBD a/DT significant/JJ premium/NN above/IN the/DT starting/VBG price."/NN However/RB Gazprom/NNP has/VBZ announced/VBN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB linked/VBN to/TO Baikal/NNP in/IN any/DT way./NN
And/CC Paul/NNP Collison/NNP chief/NN analyst/NN at/IN Brunswick/NNP UBS/NNP said/VBD "I/NN see/NN no/DT plausible/JJ explanation/NN for/IN the/DT theory/NN that/IN Baikal/NNP was/VBD representing/VBG competing/VBG interests./JJ
"Yugansk/NN will/MD most/RBS likely/JJ end/NN up/IN with/IN Gazprom/NNP but/CC could/MD still/RB end/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT government./NN
There/EX is/VBZ still/RB potential/NN for/IN surprises."/NN Yugansk/NNP is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Yukos/NNP -/: pumping/VBG close/RB to/TO a/DT million/CD barrels/NNS of/IN oil/NN a/DT day./NN
The/DT unit/NN was/VBD seized/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN which/WDT claims/NNS the/DT oil/NN giant/NN owes/VBZ more/JJR than/IN $27bn/CD in/IN taxes/NNS and/CC fines./NN
Yukos/NNP says/VBZ those/DT tax/NN demands/NNS are/VBP exorbitant/JJ and/CC had/VBD sought/VBN refuge/NN in/IN US/PRP courts./VBP

The/DT US/PRP bankruptcy/VBP court's/NNS initial/JJ order/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP -/: to/TO temporarily/RB block/VB the/DT sale/NN -/: in/IN response/NN to/TO Yukos/NNP filing/VBG for/IN Chapter/NN 11/CD bankruptcy/NN protection/NN was/VBD upheld/VBN in/IN a/DT second/JJ ruling/NN on/IN Saturday./NNP
The/DT protection/NN if/IN recognised/VBN by/IN the/DT Russian/JJ authorities/NNS would/MD have/VB allowed/VBN Yukos'/NNP current/JJ management/NN to/TO retain/VB control/NN of/IN the/DT business/NN and/CC block/VB the/DT sale/NN of/IN any/DT company/NN assets./NN
Yukos/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD the/DT sale/NN amounts/VBZ to/TO expropriation/VB -/: punishment/NN for/IN the/DT political/JJ ambitions/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ founder/NN Mikhail/NNP Khodorkovsky./NNP
Mr/NNP Khodorkovsky/NNP is/VBZ now/RB in/IN jail/NN on/IN separate/JJ fraud/NN charges./NN
But/CC President/NNP Vladimir/NNP Putin/NNP has/VBZ described/VBN the/DT affair/NN as/IN a/DT crackdown/NN on/IN corruption/NN -/: and/CC the/DT BBC's/NNP Sarah/NNP Rainsford/NNP in/IN Moscow/NNP says/VBZ most/JJS Russians/NNPS believe/VBP the/DT destruction/NN of/IN Yukos/NNP is/VBZ now/RB inevitable./NN
Hours/NNS before/IN the/DT auction/NN lawyers/NNS for/IN Menatep/NNP a/DT group/NN through/IN which/WDT Mr/NNP Khodorkovsky/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ associates/NNS control/NN Yukos/NNP said/VBD they/PRP would/MD take/VB legal/JJ action/NN in/IN other/JJ countries./NN
Menatep/NN lawyers/NNS who/WP were/VBD excluded/VBN from/IN observing/VBG the/DT auction/NN said/VBD they/PRP would/MD retaliate/VB by/IN seeking/VBG injunctions/NNS in/IN foreign/JJ courts/NNS to/TO impound/VB Russian/JJ oil/NN and/CC gas/NN exports./NN
