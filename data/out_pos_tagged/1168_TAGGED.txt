Kennedy/NNP looks/VBZ to/TO election/VB gains/NNS

They/PRP may/MD not/RB know/VB quite/RB how/WRB to/TO describe/VB their/PRP$ position/NN in/IN British/JJ politics/NNS -/: the/DT real/JJ opposition/NN the/DT valid/JJ opposition/NN the/DT effective/JJ opposition/NN or/CC the/DT authentic/JJ opposition./NN

But/CC the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS are/VBP entering/VBG the/DT expected/VBN 2005/CD election/NN campaign/NN determined/VBD to/TO prove/VB it/PRP is/VBZ they/PRP not/RB the/DT Tories/NNPS who/WP are/VBP now/RB the/DT real/JJ threat/NN to/TO Labour./NNP
As/IN Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP kicked/VBD off/RP his/PRP$ election/NN campaign/NN the/DT Lib/NNP Dem/NNP leader/NN Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP dismissed/VBD the/DT Conservatives/NNS as/IN a/DT "fading"/NN force./NN
And/CC he/PRP insisted/VBD there/EX was/VBD "no/NN limit"/NN to/TO his/PRP$ party's/NNS ambitions/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/VBG poll./NN
And/CC he/PRP can/MD produce/VB some/DT pretty/RB impressive/JJ recent/JJ election/NN results/NNS to/TO back/VB up/RP his/PRP$ optimism/NN for/IN an/DT election/NN which/WDT he/PRP believes/VBZ might/MD just/RB see/VB his/PRP$ party/NN doing/VBG big/JJ things./NN
Sensible/JJ third/JJ party/NN leaders/NNS are/VBP usually/RB cautious/JJ about/IN making/VBG any/DT predictions/NNS about/IN how/WRB they/PRP will/MD do/VB come/VB the/DT big/JJ test./NN

And/CC Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP was/VBD not/RB falling/VBG into/IN that/DT trap/NN when/WRB he/PRP fired/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ campaign/NN from/IN the/DT party's/NNS Westminster/NNP HQ./NNP
He/PRP would/MD make/VB no/DT predictions/NNS other/JJ than/IN that/IN he/PRP expected/VBD the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP to/TO increase/VB both/DT their/PRP$ votes/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ Commons/NNPS seats/NNS at/IN the/DT election./NN

The/DT gap/NN between/IN Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS was/VBD now/RB so/RB narrow/JJ -/: as/IN proved/VBD he/PRP claimed/VBN by/IN the/DT defection/NN to/TO Labour/NNP of/IN Robert/NNP Jackson/NNP -/: that/IN only/RB his/PRP$ party/NN offered/VBD a/DT genuine/JJ alternative./NN
On/IN the/DT war/NN on/IN Iraq/NNP identity/NN cards/NNS student/NN fees/NNS and/CC the/DT council/NN tax/NN there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN to/TO chose/VB between/IN the/DT two/CD big/JJ parties/NNS whereas/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS offered/VBD costed/VBN sensible/JJ alternatives./NN
He/PRP was/VBD also/RB happy/JJ to/TO break/VB the/DT two/CD party/NN consensus/NN on/IN taxation/NN by/IN promising/VBG to/TO increase/VB income/NN tax/NN on/IN those/DT earning/VBG more/JJR than/IN Â£100000/CD a/DT year/NN to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT scrapping/NN of/IN student/NN fees/NNS the/DT introduction/NN of/IN free/JJ personal/JJ care/NN for/IN the/DT elderly/JJ and/CC replacing/VBG the/DT council/NN tax/NN with/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax./NN
He/PRP was/VBD also/RB happy/JJ to/TO offer/VB a/DT pledge/NN that/IN he/PRP would/MD be/VB doing/VBG no/DT deals/NNS to/TO "prop/VB up"/NN either/CC of/IN the/DT other/JJ big/JJ parties/NNS after/IN the/DT election./NN

There/EX was/VBD a/DT time/NN when/WRB such/JJ optimistic/JJ sounds/VBZ coming/VBG from/IN the/DT third/JJ party/NN could/MD be/VB dismissed/VBN as/IN self-delusion./NN
That/DT is/VBZ no/RB longer/RB the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats./NNP
The/DT other/JJ parties/NNS will/MD still/RB insist/VB that/IN the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP are/VBP no/DT hopers/NNS whose/WP$ greatest/JJS effect/NN on/IN the/DT poll/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO boost/VB the/DT hopes/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ opponents/NNS by/IN denying/VBG them/PRP otherwise/RB winnable/JJ seats./NN

Labour/NNP in/IN particular/JJ fears/NNS that/IN disillusioned/JJ supporters/NNS may/MD switch/VB to/TO the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP allowing/VBG the/DT Tories/NNPS to/TO win/VB some/DT seats./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP is/VBZ clearly/RB hoping/VBG for/IN a/DT more/RBR significant/JJ outcome/NN than/IN that./NN
He/PRP will/MD not/RB talk/VB about/IN the/DT big/JJ breakthrough/NN although/IN there/EX are/VBP those/DT who/WP believe/VBP this/DT could/MD well/RB be/VB the/DT election/NN that/WDT sees/VBZ his/PRP$ party/NN crossing/VBG some/DT sort/NN of/IN symbolic/JJ threshold./NN
They/PRP would/MD argue/VB that/IN by/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT election/NN after/IN next/JJ the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS may/MD genuinely/RB have/VB replaced/VBN the/DT Tories/NNPS as/IN the/DT party/NN challenging/VBG Labour/NNP for/IN power./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP will/MD hope/VB to/TO have/VB made/VBN advances/NNS because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ consistent/JJ stand/VBP against/IN the/DT war/NN on/IN Iraq./NNP
But/CC Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP believes/VBZ his/PRP$ new/JJ manifesto/NN will/MD also/RB offer/VB sensible/JJ costed/VBN and/CC achievable/JJ policies/NNS on/IN things/NNS like/IN the/DT council/NN tax/NN crime/NN and/CC asylum/NN that/WDT will/MD underpin/VB his/PRP$ claim/NN that/IN his/PRP$ party/NN really/RB is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ opposition/NN worth/JJ the/DT name./NN
