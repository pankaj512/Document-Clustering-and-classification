The/DT High/NNP Court/NNP ruled/VBD on/IN Tuesday/NNP that/IN Baha/NNP Mousa's/NNP death/NN in/IN British/JJ custody/NN in/IN Iraq/NNP fell/VBD within/IN the/DT European/NNP Convention/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights./NNP
And/CC the/DT judges/NNS paved/VBD the/DT way/NN for/IN an/DT independent/JJ inquiry/NN by/IN saying/VBG previous/JJ investigations/NNS were/VBD inadequate./NN
But/CC judicial/JJ reviews/NNS into/IN five/CD other/JJ deaths/NNS in/IN southern/JJ Iraq/NNP were/VBD ruled/VBN out./NN
Their/PRP$ families/NNS will/MD be/VB appealing/VBG against/IN the/DT judgement./NN

The/DT families'/NN solicitor/NN Phil/NNP Shiner/NNP described/VBD it/PRP as/IN "a/NN historic/JJ day/NN for/IN human/JJ rights/NNS and/CC the/DT rule/NN of/IN law/NN in/IN the/DT UK"./NNP
Father-of-two/NNP Mr/NNP Mousa/NNP 28/CD a/DT hotel/NN receptionist/NN was/VBD arrested/VBN with/IN eight/CD men/NNS seized/VBD at/IN a/DT hotel/NN in/IN Basra/NNP in/IN September/NNP 2003./CD
He/PRP was/VBD allegedly/RB beaten/VBN to/TO death/NN while/IN in/IN the/DT custody/NN of/IN the/DT Queen's/NNP Lancashire/NNP Regiment./NNP

Ministry/NNP of/IN Defence/NNP lawyers/NNS argued/VBD the/DT UK-controlled/JJ area/NN of/IN southern/JJ Iraq/NNP was/VBD outside/IN European/JJ jurisdiction./NN
But/CC Lord/NNP Justice/NNP Rix/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Justice/NNP Forbes/NNP ruled/VBD that/IN UK/NNP jurisdiction/NN could/MD extend/VB to/TO a/DT UK-run/NNP prison/NN but/CC did/VBD not/RB apply/VB "to/NN the/DT total/JJ territory/NN of/IN another/DT state"./NN
They/PRP said/VBD as/IN Mr/NNP Mousa/NNP was/VBD in/IN custody/NN when/WRB he/PRP died/VBD his/PRP$ case/NN came/VBD within/IN the/DT UK's/NNP jurisdiction./NN
The/DT other/JJ five/CD Iraqis/NNP did/VBD not/RB die/VB in/IN custody/NN so/RB their/PRP$ cases/NNS had/VBD to/TO fail/VB they/PRP said./VBP

And/CC it/PRP was/VBD difficult/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT investigation/NN which/WDT had/VBD already/RB occurred/VBN "has/NN been/VBD timely/JJ open/JJ or/CC effective"/VB the/DT judges/NNS said./NN
After/IN the/DT ruling/NN Carla/NNP Ferstman/NNP legal/JJ director/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ rights/NNS organisation/NN Redress/NNP said/VBD "It/NN is/VBZ not/RB enough/RB for/IN the/DT military/JJ to/TO investigate/VB behind/IN closed/VBD doors./NN
"There/NN must/MD be/VB an/DT effective/JJ public/JJ investigation/NN by/IN an/DT independent/JJ official/JJ body./NN
Only/RB such/PDT an/DT investigation/NN could/MD reveal/VB what/WP really/RB happened/VBD and/CC who/WP might/MD be/VB responsible."/NN Other/JJ allegations/NNS involving/VBG British/JJ soldiers/NNS included/VBD the/DT shooting/NN of/IN an/DT Iraqi/JJ police/NN commissioner/NN and/CC the/DT shooting/NN of/IN four/CD Iraqi/JJ civilians/NNS in/IN May/NNP 2003./CD
Both/DT sides/NNS were/VBD granted/VBN permission/NN to/TO appeal./VB

Prime/NNP Minister/NNP Tony/NNP Blair's/NNP official/JJ spokesman/NN said/VBD "Obviously/RB we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO study/VB this/DT detailed/JJ judgment./NN
I/PRP would/MD point/VB out/RP however/RB that/IN a/DT separate/JJ criminal/JJ case/NN is/VBZ currently/RB being/VBG considered/VBN by/IN the/DT army/NN prosecuting/VBG authority./NN
"I/NN can't/NN say/VBP anything/NN further/RBR for/IN obvious/JJ reasons./NN
The/DT MoD/NNP are/VBP considering/VBG whether/IN to/TO appeal."/NN But/CC former/JJ British/NNP Commander/NNP Colonel/NNP Bob/NNP Stewart/NNP said/VBD "Anyone/NN at/IN the/DT top/JJ [of/NN the/DT military]/NN will/MD be/VB saddened/VBN by/IN the/DT verdict/NN that/WDT has/VBZ taken/VBN place/NN but/CC will/MD say/VB 'If/NN there's/NNS a/DT case/NN to/TO answer/VB let's/NNS have/VBP it/PRP out./NN
Because/IN we/PRP don't/VBP want/VBP people/NNS thinking/VBG that/IN British/JJ soldiers/NNS beat/VBP up/RP civilians/NNS and/CC get/VB away/RB with/IN it'"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"The/NNP Ministry/NNP of/IN Defence/NNP does/VBZ everything/NN in/IN its/PRP$ power/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO prove/VB we/PRP act/VBP ethically/RB and/CC properly/RB under/IN the/DT rules/NNS of/IN war."/NN
