"It's/NN an/DT important/JJ part/NN of/IN education/NN and/CC it's/VBZ an/DT important/JJ part/NN of/IN health"/NN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP said./NN
But/CC the/DT Conservatives/NNS say/VBP government/NN proposals/NNS -/: which/WDT include/VBP two/CD hours'/NN PE/NNP within/IN school/NN for/IN 75%/CD of/IN pupils/NNS by/IN 2006/CD -/: are/VBP unrealistic./NN

The/DT latest/JJS move/NN is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN encouraging/VBG more/JJR diversity/NN in/IN sport/NN with/IN activities/NNS such/JJ as/IN yoga/NN and/CC Tai/NNP Chi/NNP being/VBG options./NN

He/PRP said/VBD "You've/NN got/VBD to/TO bring/VB back/RB school/NN sport./NN
It's/NNP got/VBD to/TO be/VB done/VBN differently/RB than/IN it/PRP was/VBD 30/CD or/CC 40/CD years/NNS ago./NN
It's/NNP still/RB very/RB very/RB important."/NN

Shadow/NNP spokesman/NN for/IN sport/NN Hugh/NNP Robertson/NNP said/VBD "I/NN suspect/VBP the/DT correct/JJ way/NN to/TO tackle/VB it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT spectrum/NN and/CC try/VB to/TO enable/VB the/DT clubs/NNS -/: which/WDT is/VBZ where/WRB the/DT real/JJ passion/NN for/IN sport/NN exists/VBZ -/: to/TO deliver/VB the/DT school/NN sport/NN offer."/NN He/PRP said/VBD more/JJR emphasis/NN should/MD be/VB put/VBN on/IN traditional/JJ sports/NNS saying/VBG that/IN an/DT "anti-competitive/JJ sport/NN agenda"/NN had/VBD been/VBN pursued/VBN in/IN recent/JJ years./NN
