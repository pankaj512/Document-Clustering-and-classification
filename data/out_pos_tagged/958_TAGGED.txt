Muslims/NNS discuss/VBP election/NN concerns/NNS

Issues/NNS that/IN Muslims/NNPS should/MD be/VB considering/VBG before/IN voting/VBG in/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election/NN are/VBP to/TO be/VB debated/VBN by/IN UK/NNP community/NN representatives./NN

The/DT event/NN is/VBZ being/VBG held/VBN by/IN the/DT Muslim/NNP Association/NNP of/IN Britain/NNP (MAB)/NN which/WDT believes/VBZ Muslim/NNP voters/NNS could/MD influence/VB the/DT result/NN in/IN up/IN to/TO 50/CD constituencies./NN
Last/JJ year/NN MAB/NNP which/WDT opposed/VBD the/DT war/NN in/IN Iraq/NNP urged/VBD Muslims/NNPS not/RB to/TO vote/VB for/IN Labour/NNP in/IN the/DT European/JJ elections./NN
But/CC a/DT spokesman/NN stressed/VBD the/DT meeting/NN was/VBD "not/NN necessarily/RB anti-Labour"./JJ
"This/NN meeting/NN is/VBZ not/RB anti-party/JJ in/IN particular/JJ it's/NNS anti-policy/NN it's/NNS on/IN the/DT issues/NNS we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO ask/VB Muslims/NNPS to/TO vote/VB on"/NN MAB/NNP spokesman/NN Dr/NNP Azzam/NNP Tamimi/NNP said/VBD of/IN Tuesday's/NNP event./NN

"There/NN are/VBP issues/NNS of/IN concern/NN to/TO Muslims/NNPS and/CC Muslims/NNPS generally/RB agree/VBP on/IN them/PRP but/CC have/VBP not/RB in/IN the/DT past/JJ been/VBN aware/JJ of/IN how/WRB a/DT vote/NN can/MD serve/VB these/DT issues."/NN Dr/NNP Tamimi/NNP said/VBD the/DT main/JJ issues/NNS Muslims/NNPS should/MD consider/VB were/VB what/WP he/PRP referred/VBD to/TO as/IN the/DT war/NN on/IN Iraq/NNP the/DT Palestinian/JJ situation/NN the/DT erosion/NN of/IN civil/JJ liberties/NNS for/IN Muslims/NNPS in/IN the/DT UK/NNP and/CC economic/JJ social/JJ and/CC education/NN problems./NN

Approximately/RB 1.1m/CD of/IN the/DT UK's/NNP 1.6m/CD Muslims/NNPS are/VBP of/IN voting/VBG age./NN
Previous/JJ election/NN research/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN the/DT overwhelming/JJ majority/NN have/VBP traditionally/RB voted/VBN Labour/NNP but/CC more/RBR recent/JJ studies/NNS have/VBP suggested/VBN Labour/NNP support/NN has/VBZ been/VBN falling/VBG away/RB significantly/RB among/IN some/DT Muslim/NNP voters./NN

Anger/NN over/IN the/DT war/NN in/IN Iraq/NNP has/VBZ appeared/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT main/JJ reason/NN with/IN many/JJ saying/VBG it/PRP was/VBD "unjustified"./NN
Representatives/NNS from/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN Muslim/NNP organisations/NNS will/MD attend/VB Tuesday's/NNP event./NN
Among/IN them/PRP will/MD be/VB the/DT Muslim/NNP Council/NNP of/IN Britain/NNP (MCB)./NN
The/DT chairman/NN of/IN the/DT MCB's/NNP public/JJ affairs/NNS committee/NN Sher/NNP Khan/NNP said/VBD the/DT war/NN in/IN Iraq/NNP would/MD be/VB a/DT "significant/NN factor"/NN affecting/VBG Muslims'/NNP voting/NN intentions./NN
"I/NN think/VBP it's/NNS going/VBG to/TO be/VB quite/RB significant/JJ because/IN of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN seats/NNS in/IN which/WDT they/PRP could/MD have/VB an/DT impact"/NN Mr/NNP Khan/NNP said./NN

However/RB Professor/NNP John/NNP Curtice/NNP of/IN the/DT University/NNP of/IN Strathclyde/NNP is/VBZ sceptical/JJ about/IN how/WRB much/JJ difference/NN tactical/JJ voting/NN by/IN Muslims/NNPS could/MD make./VB
"For/NN the/DT most/JJS part/NN the/DT Labour/NNP constituencies/NNS where/WRB there's/NNS a/DT large/JJ Muslim/NNP community/NN are/VBP relatively/RB safe/JJ but/CC there/EX are/VBP one/CD or/CC two/CD that/WDT are/VBP not/RB quite/RB so/RB safe"/NN Professor/NNP Curtice/NNP said./NN

The/DT constituencies/NNS where/WRB Labour/NNP was/VBD most/JJS at/IN risk/NN from/IN a/DT Muslim/NNP tactical/JJ vote/NN were/VBD Bethnal/NNP Green/NNP in/IN east/JJ London/NNP and/CC Rochdale/NNP in/IN Lancashire/NNP he/PRP added./VB
In/IN Bethnal/NNP Green/NNP former/JJ Labour/NNP MP/NNP George/NNP Galloway/NNP who/WP founded/VBD the/DT anti-war/JJ party/NN Respect/NN is/VBZ standing/NN against/IN sitting/VBG MP/NNP Oona/NNP King/NNP who/WP had/VBD a/DT 10000-vote/JJ majority/NN in/IN 2001./CD
In/IN Rochdale/NNP the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS -/: the/DT mainstream/NN party/NN a/DT 2004/CD ICM/NNP survey/NN showed/VBD was/VBD benefiting/VBG most/JJS from/IN Muslim/NNP disaffection/NN with/IN Labour/NNP -/: secured/VBN second/JJ place/NN in/IN the/DT 2001/CD election/NN securing/VBG just/RB under/IN 6000/CD votes/NNS fewer/JJR than/IN Labour's/NNP Lorna/NNP Fitzsimons./NNP
But/CC Professor/NNP Curtice/NNP said/VBD the/DT Muslim/NNP anti-war/JJ vote/NN could/MD be/VB split/VBN between/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS and/CC Respect/NN meaning/VBG neither/DT would/MD benefit/VB much/JJ at/IN the/DT ballot/NN box./NN
"Ironically/RB the/DT Tories/NNPS might/MD be/VB the/DT beneficiaries/NNS if/IN Labour/NNP does/VBZ lose/VB seats/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ generally/RB the/DT case"/NN he/PRP said./VB
But/CC Dr/NNP Tamimi/NNP said/VBD MAB's/NNP intention/NN was/VBD not/RB to/TO "empower"/VB the/DT Tories./NNP
"We/NN know/VBP the/DT next/JJ government/NN will/MD be/VB Labour/NNP but/CC we/PRP are/VBP aiming/VBG to/TO send/VB a/DT message/NN that/IN it/PRP will/MD make/VB a/DT difference/NN if/IN the/DT Muslims/NNPS use/VBP their/PRP$ vote/NN properly./NN
"If/NN the/DT next/JJ Labour/NNP government/NN has/VBZ a/DT reduced/VBN majority/NN that's/NNS a/DT great/JJ achievement/NN because/IN having/VBG a/DT very/RB big/JJ majority/NN has/VBZ been/VBN very/RB harmful/JJ for/IN politics/NNS in/IN this/DT country"/NN Dr/NNP Tamimi/NNP said./NN
