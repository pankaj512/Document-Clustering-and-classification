Profile/NNP Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP

The/DT ultimate/JJ prize/NN of/IN 10/CD Downing/NNP Street/NNP may/MD continue/VB to/TO elude/VB him/PRP but/CC as/IN he/PRP prepares/VBZ to/TO deliver/VB a/DT record-breaking/JJ ninth/JJ budget/NN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP can/MD at/IN least/JJS console/NN himself/PRP with/IN the/DT thought/JJ that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ the/DT longest/JJS serving/VBG chancellor/NN of/IN modern/JJ times./NN

He/PRP reached/VBD that/DT milestone/NN last/JJ June/NNP when/WRB he/PRP overtook/VB David/NNP Lloyd/NNP George/NNP who/WP served/VBD for/IN seven/CD years/NNS and/CC 43/CD days/NNS between/IN 1908/CD and/CC 1915./CD
How/WRB much/RB longer/RB Mr/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD continue/VB in/IN the/DT job/NN is/VBZ not/RB clear/JJ (he/NN once/RB said/VBD there/EX are/VBP two/CD types/NNS of/IN chancellor/NN "those/NN who/WP fail/VBP and/CC those/DT who/WP get/VBP out/RP in/IN time.")/NN There/EX are/VBP rumours/NNS he/PRP will/MD be/VB moved/VBN to/TO the/DT Foreign/NNP Office/NNP if/IN Labour/NNP wins/VBZ the/DT general/JJ election./NN
But/CC for/IN now/RB Mr/NNP Brown/NNP dominates/VBZ the/DT domestic/JJ political/JJ scene/NN like/IN few/JJ chancellors/NNS -/: or/CC politicians/NNS -/: before/IN him./NN

Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP was/VBD born/VBN in/IN Glasgow/NNP on/IN 20/CD February/NNP 1951/CD the/DT son/NN of/IN a/DT Church/NNP of/IN Scotland/NNP Minister/NNP in/IN the/DT small/JJ Fife/NNP town/NN of/IN Kirkcaldy./NNP
At/IN 12/CD he/PRP was/VBD canvassing/VBG for/IN Labour/NNP and/CC by/IN his/PRP$ 20s/NNS he/PRP was/VBD a/DT leading/JJ political/JJ activist/NN in/IN Scotland./NNP
He/PRP achieved/VBD a/DT first/JJ class/NN degree/NN in/IN history/NN from/IN Edinburgh/NNP University/NNP where/WRB he/PRP went/VBD on/RP to/TO complete/VB a/DT PhD./NNP
His/PRP$ early/JJ career/NN was/VBD spent/VBN lecturing/VBG working/VBG in/IN television/NN and/CC making/VBG a/DT name/NN for/IN himself/PRP in/IN the/DT Scottish/NNP Labour/NNP Party./NNP

His/PRP$ first/JJ attempt/NN to/TO enter/VB Westminster/NNP for/IN Edinburgh/NNP South/NNP in/IN 1979/CD was/VBD thwarted/VBN by/IN the/DT present/JJ Tory/NNP spokesman/NN on/IN foreign/JJ affairs/NNS Michael/NNP Ancram./NNP
But/CC in/IN 1983/CD he/PRP took/VBD Dunfermline/NNP East/NNP a/DT new/JJ constituency/NN including/VBG Rosyth/NNP naval/JJ base/NN pit/NN villages/NNS and/CC coastal/JJ towns./NN

Entering/VBG Westminster/NNP he/PRP came/VBD to/TO share/VB an/DT office/NN with/IN the/DT newly/RB elected/VBN MP/NNP for/IN Sedgefield/NNP Tony/NNP Blair./NNP
Within/IN four/CD years/NNS Mr/NNP Brown/NNP had/VBD gained/VBN his/PRP$ first/JJ frontbench/NN post/NN as/IN shadow/NN chief/NN secretary/NN to/TO the/DT Treasury./NNP
He/PRP became/VBD shadow/NN chancellor/NN under/IN John/NNP Smith's/NNP leadership/NN in/IN 1992./CD
After/IN the/DT death/NN of/IN leader/NN John/NNP Smith/NNP in/IN 1994/CD he/PRP stood/VBD aside/RB agreeing/VBG to/TO give/VB Tony/NNP Blair/NNP a/DT clear/JJ run/NN at/IN the/DT leadership/NN during/IN a/DT now/RB infamous/JJ meal/NN at/IN the/DT Granita/NNP restaurant/NN in/IN Islington./NNP

The/DT other/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT deal/NN that/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP will/MD one/CD day/NN stand/VBP down/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT chancellor/NN is/VBZ the/DT stuff/NN of/IN Westminster/NNP legend./NN
Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP supporters/NNS say/VBP such/PDT a/DT deal/NN never/RB existed/VBD and/CC endless/JJ newspaper/NN columns/NNS -/: and/CC even/RB a/DT television/NN film/NN -/: have/VBP been/VBN devoted/VBN to/TO the/DT alleged/VBN deal./NN
But/CC if/IN his/PRP$ leadership/NN ambitions/NNS were/VBD at/IN least/JJS temporarily/RB thwarted/VBN in/IN 1994/CD Mr/NNP Brown/NNP continued/VBD his/PRP$ devotion/NN to/TO politics./VB
During/IN the/DT 1997/CD election/NN campaign/NN he/PRP is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO have/VB worked/VBN an/DT average/NN of/IN 18/CD hours/NNS a/DT day/NN six/CD days/NNS a/DT week/NN after/IN running/VBG on/IN a/DT treadmill/NN for/IN an/DT hour/NN each/DT morning./NN

This/DT dedication/NN to/TO his/PRP$ career/NN was/VBD underlined/VBN by/IN a/DT comment/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP former/JJ girlfriend/NN of/IN five/CD years/NNS Princess/NNP Marguerite/NNP of/IN Romania/NNP the/DT eldest/JJ daughter/NN of/IN ex-King/NN Michael/NNP of/IN Romania/NNP who/WP said/VBD a/DT relationship/NN with/IN him/PRP was/VBD "politics/NN politics/NNS politics"./NN

If/IN that/DT was/VBD true/JJ then/RB Mr/NNP Brown/NNP who/WP married/JJ PR/NNP executive/NN Sarah/NNP Macaulay/NNP in/IN 2000/CD changed/VBN his/PRP$ perspective/NN when/WRB the/DT couple/NN were/VBD hit/VBN by/IN tragedy/NN early/RB in/IN 2002./CD
Their/PRP$ daughter/NN Jennifer/NNP died/VBD in/IN Edinburgh/NNP Royal/NNP Infirmary/NNP 10/CD days/NNS after/IN being/VBG born/VBN seven/CD weeks/NNS prematurely./NN
A/DT year/NN later/RB in/IN October/NNP 2003/CD the/DT couple/NN had/VBD a/DT son/NN -/: John/NNP -/: an/DT event/NN which/WDT again/RB gave/VBD the/DT chancellor/NN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO show/VB his/PRP$ softer/JJR side./NN
A/DT trip/NN to/TO Africa/NNP earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN to/TO publicise/VB his/PRP$ scheme/NN to/TO cancel/VB the/DT debt/NN of/IN poor/JJ nations/NNS also/RB gave/VBD the/DT chancellor/NN an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO show/VB his/PRP$ more/RBR human/JJ side./NN

The/DT ideological/JJ differences/NNS between/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Blair/NNP remain/VB relatively/RB modest./NN
The/DT chancellor/NN opposes/VBZ the/DT further/JJ encroachment/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN into/IN the/DT NHS/NNP and/CC is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN being/VBG more/JJR "Old/NN Labour"/NNP than/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP in/IN his/PRP$ approach/NN to/TO wealth/NN redistribution./NN
But/CC their/PRP$ shared/VBN belief/NN that/DT market/NN economics/NNS are/VBP compatible/JJ with/IN social/JJ justice/NN continues/VBZ to/TO form/VB the/DT ideological/JJ heart/NN of/IN the/DT New/NNP Labour/NNP project./NN
Yet/CC they/PRP are/VBP portrayed/VBN by/IN the/DT media/NNS as/IN being/VBG locked/VBN in/IN almost/RB permanent/JJ conflict/NN with/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP supposedly/RB nursing/NN resentment/NN at/IN being/VBG betrayed/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ younger/JJR Downing/NNP Street/NNP neighbour/NN over/IN the/DT succession./NN
Mr/NNP Blair/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ part/NN is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB frustrated/VBN that/IN his/PRP$ public/JJ service/NN reforms/NNS are/VBP being/VBG thwarted/VBN by/IN a/DT vengeful/JJ Mr/NNP Brown/NNP who/WP reportedly/RB delights/VBZ in/IN keeping/VBG the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN in/IN the/DT dark/NN over/IN the/DT contents/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ Budget/NNP until/IN the/DT last/JJ possible/JJ minute./NN
After/IN a/DT recent/JJ run/NN of/IN negative/JJ headlines/NNS Labour/NNP MPs/NNP took/VBD the/DT unprecedented/JJ step/NN of/IN making/VBG a/DT direct/JJ appeal/NN to/TO the/DT two/CD men/NNS stop/VBP bickering/NN for/IN the/DT good/NN of/IN the/DT party./NN
Events/NNS like/IN this/DT and/CC the/DT testimony/NN of/IN former/JJ ministerial/JJ colleagues/NNS make/VBP it/PRP impossible/JJ to/TO dismiss/VB the/DT Brown/Blair/NNP feud/NN as/RB just/RB journalistic/JJ hearsay/NN cooked/VBD up/RP by/IN hacks/NNS and/CC camp/NN followers/NNS in/IN the/DT hothouse/NN atmosphere/NN of/IN Westminster./NNP
How/WRB much/JJ it/PRP damages/VBZ the/DT ability/NN of/IN government/NN to/TO do/VB its/PRP$ job/NN is/VBZ open/JJ to/TO question./VB

A/DT truce/NN appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB been/VBN called/VBN in/RP the/DT run/NN up/IN to/TO the/DT general/JJ election/NN after/IN a/DT fresh/JJ spat/NN was/VBD sparked/VBN by/IN Blairite/NNP Alan/NNP Milburn/NNP being/VBG brought/VBN in/RP over/IN the/DT head/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP to/TO run/VB the/DT election/NN campaign./NN
But/CC with/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS having/VBG appeared/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT better/JJR of/IN the/DT pre-election/JJ campaign/NN thus/RB far/RB there/EX are/VBP reports/NNS that/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP -/: using/VBG the/DT Budget/NNP as/IN a/DT springboard/NN -/: is/VBZ to/TO revitalise/VB Labour's/NNP campaign./NN
Amid/IN all/PDT this/DT it/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO forget/VB that/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP remains/VBZ the/DT man/NN most/RBS likely/JJ to/TO succeed/VB Mr/NNP Blair/NNP as/IN Labour/NNP leader./NN
There/EX may/MD be/VB no/DT shortage/NN of/IN possible/JJ contenders/NNS for/IN the/DT crown/NN -/: including/VBG Mr/NNP Milburn/NNP -/: but/CC none/NN can/MD command/VB the/DT sort/NN of/IN support/NN in/IN the/DT parliamentary/JJ party/NN and/CC beyond/IN that/DT Mr/NNP Brown/NNP can./NN
And/CC Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP decision/NN to/TO name/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ retirement/NN date/NN has/VBZ at/IN least/JJS given/VBN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP something/NN to/TO aim/VB for/IN -/: even/RB if/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister's/NNS intention/NN to/TO "serve/VB a/DT full/JJ third/JJ term"/NN if/IN elected/VBN took/VBD the/DT shine/NN off/RP the/DT announcement/NN for/IN the/DT chancellor/NN and/CC his/PRP$ supporters./NN
