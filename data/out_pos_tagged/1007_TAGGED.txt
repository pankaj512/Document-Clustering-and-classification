Ex-BBC/NN chat/NN show/NN host/NN and/CC East/NNP Midlands/NNP MEP/NNP Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN he/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO "change/VB the/DT face/NN of/IN British/JJ politics"/NN as/IN he/PRP launched/VBD his/PRP$ new/JJ party./NN

Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP who/WP recently/RB quit/VBD the/DT UK/NNP Independence/NNP Partysaid/NNP "our/NN country"/NN was/VBD being/VBG "stolen/NN from/IN us"/NN by/IN mass/NN immigration./NN
He/PRP told/VBD a/DT London/NNP news/NN conference/NN that/IN Veritas/NNP -/: Latin/NNP for/IN "truth"/NN -/: would/MD avoid/VB the/DT old/JJ parties'/NN "lies/NN and/CC spin"./NN
UKIP/NNP leader/NN Roger/NNP Knapman/NNP says/VBZ he/PRP was/VBD glad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT back/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk./NNP

Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP promised/VBD a/DT "firm/NN but/CC fair"/NN policy/NN on/IN immigration/NN and/CC said/VBD they/PRP hoped/VBD to/TO contest/VB most/JJS seats/NNS at/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ general/JJ election./NN
He/PRP said/VBD Veritas/NNP would/MD also/RB announce/VB detailed/JJ policies/NNS on/IN crime/NN tax/NN pensions/NNS health/NN and/CC defence/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks./NN
And/CC he/PRP announced/VBD the/DT party/NN would/MD be/VB holding/VBG a/DT leadership/NN election./NN
On/IN Thursday/NNP he/PRP is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO announce/VB which/WDT constituency/NN he/PRP will/MD run/VB in/IN at/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election/NN -/: that/WDT will/MD come/VB amid/IN speculation/NN he/PRP has/VBZ his/PRP$ sights/NNS set/VBN on/IN Defence/NNP Secretary/NNP Geoff/NNP Hoon's/NNP Ashfield/NNP seat./NN
He/PRP was/VBD joined/VBN in/IN the/DT new/JJ venture/NN by/IN one/CD of/IN UKIP's/NNP two/CD London/NNP Assembly/NNP members/NNS Damien/NNP Hockney/NNP who/WP is/VBZ now/RB Veritas'/NNP deputy/NN leader./NN
UKIP's/NNP chairman/NN Petrina/NNP Holdsworth/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD the/DT group/NN will/MD just/RB be/VB a/DT parody/NN of/IN the/DT party/NN the/DT men/NNS have/VBP left./NN

Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP announced/VBD his/PRP$ decision/NN to/TO quit/VB UKIP/NNP at/IN a/DT public/JJ meeting/NN in/IN Hinckley/NNP Leicestershire/NNP last/JJ week./NN
It/PRP came/VBD after/IN months/NNS of/IN tension/NN as/IN he/PRP vied/VBD unsuccessfully/RB for/IN the/DT leadership/NN of/IN that/DT party./NN
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD ashamed/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT UKIP/NNP whose/WP$ leadership/NN had/VBD "gone/JJ AWOL"/NNP after/IN the/DT great/JJ opportunity/NN offered/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ third/JJ place/NN at/IN last/JJ June's/JJ European/JJ elections./NN
"While/NNP UKIP/NNP has/VBZ turned/VBN its/PRP$ back/RB on/IN the/DT British/JJ people/NNS I/PRP shall/MD not"/VB he/PRP said./VB
"I/NN will/MD be/VB standing/NN at/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election./NN
I/PRP shall/MD be/VB leading/VBG a/DT vigorous/JJ campaign/NN for/IN the/DT causes/NNS I/PRP believe/VBP in./NN
"And/NN unlike/IN the/DT old/JJ parties/NNS we/PRP shall/MD be/VB honest/JJ open/JJ and/CC straight."/NN

Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP also/RB left/VBD UKIP/NNP saying/VBG Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP would/MD "deliver/VB better"/NN as/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN a/DT Eurosceptic/NNP party./NN
A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN UKIP/NNP called/VBD on/IN Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP to/TO quit/VB the/DT London/NNP Assembly./NNP
The/DT party/NN asserts/VBZ that/IN Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP "has/NN a/DT moral/JJ obligation/NN if/IN not/RB a/DT legal/JJ one"/NN to/TO stand/VB down./NN
Its/PRP$ leader/NN Roger/NNP Knapman/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN he/PRP is/VBZ glad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT back/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk./NNP
"He/NN has/VBZ remarkable/JJ ability/NN to/TO influence/VB people/NNS but/CC sadly/RB after/IN the/DT [European]/NN election/NN it/PRP became/VBD clear/JJ that/IN he/PRP was/VBD more/RBR interested/JJ in/IN the/DT Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP Party/NNP than/IN the/DT UK/NNP Independence/NNP Party/NNP so/IN it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ knowing/NN him/PRP now/RB 'goodbye'"/VBP he/PRP said./VB
UKIP/NN officials/NNS also/RB argue/VBP Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN "straightforward"/NN in/IN attacking/VBG the/DT party/NN he/PRP once/RB wanted/VBD to/TO lead./VB

This/DT is/VBZ just/RB what/WP the/DT Europhiles/NNP pray/NN for./NN
As/IN the/DT main/JJ Eurosceptic/NNP party/NN UKIP/NNP should/MD try/VB to/TO resolve/VB its/PRP$ differences/NNS with/IN Kilroy/NNP to/TO show/VB a/DT united/VBN front/NN and/CC give/VB the/DT UK/NNP public/VBD a/DT serious/JJ political/JJ voice/NN against/IN Europe./NNP
Having/VBG multiple/JJ parties/NNS with/IN the/DT same/JJ view/NN point/NN just/RB splits/VBZ the/DT vote/NN further./NN

Thank/VB goodness/NN that/IN Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ gone/VBN -/: now/RB UKIP/NNP at/IN least/JJS has/VBZ a/DT chance/NN in/IN the/DT election/NN

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB sad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN Britain/NNP regaining/VBG its/PRP$ proper/JJ relationship/NN with/IN Europe/NNP damaged/VBD by/IN this/DT split/VBN within/IN UKIP./NNP
Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP could/MD have/VB a/DT lot/NN to/TO offer./VB
Instead/RB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT split/NN party/NN and/CC a/DT damaged/VBN cause./NN
Under/IN the/DT present/JJ electoral/JJ system/NN people/NNS must/MD work/VB together/RB and/CC small/JJ parties/NNS have/VBP no/DT hope/NN of/IN representation./NN
Last/JJ summer/NN UKIP/NNP achieved/VBD a/DT major/JJ advance/NN partly/RB and/CC only/RB partly/RB due/JJ to/TO Kilroy-Silk./NNP
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ shame/NN this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN dissipated/VBN in/IN in-fighting./JJ

UKIP/NNP has/VBZ a/DT wide/JJ platform/NN of/IN policies/NNS not/RB just/RB withdrawal/NN from/IN the/DT EU./NNP
This/DT Kilroy-Silk/NNP conveniently/RB ignores/VBZ in/IN the/DT comments/NNS surrounding/VBG the/DT launch/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ party./NN
Neither/DT the/DT English/NNP Democrats/NNPS nor/CC the/DT New/NNP Party/NNP were/VBD interested/JJ in/IN letting/VBG him/PRP join/VB them/PRP and/CC take/VB over/RP their/PRP$ leadership/NN speaks/VBZ volumes./NN
Veritas/NNP is/VBZ the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN for/IN Kilroy-Silk./NNP

If/IN he/PRP believes/VBZ in/IN truth/NN and/CC democracy/NN then/RB he/PRP and/CC the/DT two/CD assembly/NN members/NNS should/MD resign/VB and/CC force/VB a/DT by-elections/NNS to/TO stand/VB on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ platform/NN rather/RB than/IN this/DT backdoor/NN approach/NN to/TO politics/NNS of/IN being/VBG elected/VBN for/IN one/CD party/NN then/RB defecting/VBG to/TO another./VB

So/RB UKIP/NNP was/VBD good/JJ enough/RB for/IN him/PRP to/TO lead/VB not/RB good/JJ enough/RB for/IN him/PRP to/TO follow/VB

Interesting/JJ that/IN a/DT party/NN committed/VBN to/TO plain/JJ speaking/NN should/MD have/VB a/DT Latin/NNP name/NN

Every/DT opinion/NN poll/NN points/NNS to/TO an/DT overwhelming/JJ anti-Europe/JJ feeling/NN in/IN this/DT country./NN
Kilroy-Silk/NNP could/MD be/VB on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN something/NN huge/JJ if/IN he/PRP can/MD broaden/VB his/PRP$ appeal/NN beyond/IN this/DT one/CD issue./NN
He/PRP is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB able/JJ communicator/NN with/IN years/NNS of/IN political/JJ experience./NN
We/PRP wants/VBZ quality/NN schools/NNS top/JJ hospitals/NNS clean/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ public/JJ transport/NN punishments/NNS that/WDT fit/VBP the/DT crime/NN limited/JJ asylum/NN a/DT purge/NN on/IN bureaucracy/NN and/CC less/JJR taxes./NN
It/PRP needs/VBZ courage/NN and/CC honesty/NN two/CD qualities/NNS sadly/RB lacking/VBG in/IN our/PRP$ politicians./NN
Kilroy-Silk/NNP may/MD just/RB have/VB those/DT very/JJ qualities./NN
Recruit/VBG the/DT right/JJ colleagues/NNS Robert/NNP and/CC your/PRP$ time/NN may/MD have/VB come/VBN

Well/RB if/IN you/PRP cannot/VBP get/NN enough/JJ limelight/NN being/VBG an/DT ordinary/JJ MP/NNP then/RB go/VBD out/RB and/CC start/VB up/RP your/PRP$ own/JJ Party./NNP
It's/VBG all/DT flash/NN and/CC no/DT real/JJ policy/NN here/RB

Let's/NNP hope/NN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT start/NN of/IN both/DT UKIP/NNP and/CC Kilroy-Silk/NNP slipping/VBG into/IN obscurity./NN

Veritas?/VBG The/DT name/NN will/MD doom/VB it./NN
But/CC perhaps/RB I/PRP am/VBP wrong/JJ for/IN surely/RB all/DT modern/JJ schoolchildren/NNS will/MD understand/VB it/PRP since/IN they/PRP do/VBP still/RB learn/VB Latin/NNP in/IN the/DT classroom/NN do/VBP they/PRP not?/VBP The/DT whole/JJ essence/NN of/IN what/WP RKS/NNP represents/VBZ is/VBZ Euroscepticism/NNP so/RB explain/VBP to/TO me/PRP how/WRB the/DT too-twee/JJ label/NN of/IN Veritas/NNP symbolises/NNS that?/NN
