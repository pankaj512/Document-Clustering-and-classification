Ministers/NNS are/VBP telling/VBG councils/NNS to/TO find/VB more/JJR sites/NNS for/IN travellers/NNS amid/IN continuing/VBG rows/NNS concerning/VBG a/DT string/NN of/IN unauthorised/VBN encampments./NN

Councils/NNS are/VBP also/RB to/TO be/VB given/VBN stronger/JJR powers/NNS to/TO move/VB on/IN illegal/JJ settlements/NNS by/IN Gypsy/NN communities/NNS on/IN rural/JJ land./NN
More/JJR money/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB given/VBN to/TO councils/NNS to/TO develop/VB official/JJ caravan/NN parks/NNS said/VBD housing/NN minister/NN Yvette/NNP Cooper./NNP
In/IN November/NNP MPs/NNP urged/VBD ministers/NNS to/TO make/VB councils/NNS create/VB sites/NNS because/IN 3500/CD travellers/NNS have/VBP no/DT place/NN to/TO stop./VB
Ms/NNP Cooper/NNP said/VBD an/DT annual/JJ scheme/NN to/TO refurbish/VB existing/VBG traveller/NN sites/NNS would/MD now/RB be/VB extended/VBN to/TO consider/VB council/NN bids/NNS for/IN new/JJ stopping/NN places./NN
That/DT scheme/NN has/VBZ paid/VBN out/RP £25m/CD in/IN four/CD years/NNS with/IN £8m/CD available/JJ for/IN 2005./CD

"There/NN are/VBP two/CD major/JJ problems/NNS in/IN the/DT planning/NN system/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN concerning/VBG Gypsy/NN and/CC traveller/NN sites"/NN said/VBD Ms/NNP Cooper./NNP
"Firstly/RB local/JJ authorities/NNS are/VBP not/RB identifying/VBG enough/RB appropriate/JJ locations/NNS either/CC for/IN private/JJ or/CC public/JJ sites./NN
And/CC secondly/RB they/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB enough/JJ powers/NNS to/TO deal/VB swiftly/RB with/IN development/NN on/IN inappropriate/JJ sites./NN
"The/NN result/NN is/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP too/RB many/JJ developments/NNS on/IN inappropriate/JJ sites/NNS causing/VBG tensions/NNS and/CC difficulties/NNS for/IN both/DT the/DT neighbouring/VBG communities/NNS and/CC the/DT Gypsies/NNP and/CC travellers./NN
"That/NN is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP consulting/NN on/IN a/DT new/JJ obligation/NN on/IN local/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO identify/VB more/RBR appropriate/JJ sites/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN new/JJ powers/NNS to/TO take/VB immediate/JJ action/NN if/IN the/DT development/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT wrong/JJ place/NN and/CC cannot/NN be/VB tolerated/VBN in/IN even/RB the/DT short-term/NN because/IN of/IN risk/NN to/TO local/JJ amenity/NN and/CC the/DT environment."/NN Under/IN the/DT new/JJ regulations/NNS expected/VBN to/TO be/VB in/IN force/NN in/IN the/DT spring/NN officials/NNS will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO serve/VB "temporary/NN stop/NN notices"/NN aimed/VBN at/IN preventing/NN works/VBZ on/IN a/DT site/NN before/IN a/DT council/NN has/VBZ had/VBN chance/NN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT full/JJ legal/JJ ban./NN
Many/JJ MPs/NNP with/IN rural/JJ constituencies/NNS particularly/RB in/IN eastern/JJ England/NNP have/VBP been/VBN pressing/VBG the/DT government/NN to/TO create/VB stronger/JJR enforcement/NN powers/NNS saying/VBG villagers/NNS are/VBP suffering/VBG because/IN of/IN the/DT legal/JJ delays/NNS in/IN removing/VBG illegal/JJ encampments./NN

Andrew/NNP Ryder/NNP of/IN the/DT Traveller/NNP Law/NNP Reform/NNP Coalition/NNP said/VBD "We/NN welcome/VBN talk/VB about/IN an/DT obligation/NN on/IN councils/NNS to/TO identify/VB land/NN for/IN Gypsies/NNP and/CC travellers/NNS so/RB long/RB as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ obligation/NN as/IN opposed/VBN to/TO a/DT recommendation/NN which/WDT could/MD be/VB and/CC was/VBN easily/RB ignored./NN
"New/NN accommodation/NN proposals/NNS for/IN travellers/NNS need/VBP to/TO be/VB backed/VBN up/RP with/IN decent/JJ funding/NN and/CC intervention/NN by/IN the/DT government/NN when/WRB councils/NNS attempt/VBP to/TO dodge/VB their/PRP$ responsibilities/NNS towards/IN travellers/NNS as/IN they/PRP often/RB do./VBP
"Living/VBG on/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT road/NN or/CC being/VBG worn/JJ down/RP by/IN planning/NN appeals/NNS legal/JJ action/NN and/CC eviction/NN is/VBZ no/DT one's/NNS idea/NN of/IN fun."/NN In/IN their/PRP$ November/NNP report/NN MPs/NNP from/IN the/DT committee/NN scrutinising/VBG the/DT Office/NNP for/IN the/DT Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP responsible/JJ for/IN housing/NN said/VBD most/RBS illegal/JJ traveller/NN encampments/NNS were/VBD caused/VBN by/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN places/NNS to/TO stop./VB
Numerous/JJ communities/NNS and/CC councils/NNS were/VBD paying/VBG for/IN lengthy/JJ and/CC expensive/JJ evictions/NNS against/IN travelling/VBG communities/NNS said/VBD the/DT MPs./NNP
In/IN turn/VBP the/DT problems/NNS had/VBD worsened/VBN because/IN councils/NNS were/VBD reluctant/JJ to/TO voluntarily/RB provide/VB sites/NNS because/IN of/IN resistance/NN from/IN residents./NN
