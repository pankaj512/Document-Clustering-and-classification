Will/MD the/DT Budget/NNP bring/VB out/RP smiling/VBG voters?/NN

As/IN Tory/NNP spokesman/NN Oliver/NNP Letwin/NNP said/VBD -/: any/DT chancellor/NN would/MD use/VB his/PRP$ pre-election/JJ budget/NN to/TO offer/VB some/DT vote/NN winning/VBG sweeteners/NNS wouldn't/NN he./NN

And/CC everyone/NN does/VBZ indeed/RB expect/VB Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP to/TO do/VB just/RB that/IN in/IN his/PRP$ last/JJ budget/NN before/IN the/DT expected/JJ polling/NN day/NN of/IN 5/CD May./NNP
There/EX will/MD be/VB plenty/NN of/IN talk/NN about/IN taking/VBG no/DT risks/NNS with/IN the/DT economy/NN or/CC handing/VBG out/RP irresponsible/JJ giveaways./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD stun/VB Westminster/NNP and/CC break/VB just/RB about/IN every/DT historical/JJ precedent/NN if/IN he/PRP fails/VBZ to/TO do/VB something/NN designed/VBN to/TO put/VB a/DT smile/NN on/IN voters'/NN faces/VBZ and/CC make/VB them/PRP more/RBR inclined/JJ to/TO back/VB Labour/NNP in/IN the/DT election./NN
And/CC there/EX has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN speculation/NN about/IN possible/JJ tax/NN reductions/NNS for/IN the/DT poorest/JJS and/CC increasing/VBG the/DT threshold/NN on/IN stamp/NN duty/NN in/IN this/DT week's/NNS Budget./NNP
The/DT aim/NN of/IN his/PRP$ package/NN will/MD be/VB to/TO keep/VB any/DT disillusioned/JJ core/NN Labour/NNP voters/NNS in/IN the/DT fold/NN while/IN ensuring/VBG the/DT middle/NN England/NNP voters/NNS who/WP gave/VBD Tony/NNP Blair/NNP two/CD election/NN victories/NNS don't/NN desert/NN him/PRP at/IN the/DT third/JJ poll./NN

And/CC needless/JJ to/TO say/VB there/EX will/MD be/VB plenty/NN of/IN analysis/NN of/IN what/WDT impact/NN the/DT Budget/NNP will/MD have/VB on/IN Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP own/JJ ambitions/NNS to/TO replace/VB Mr/NNP Blair/NNP as/IN prime/JJ minister/NN at/IN some/DT point/NN after/IN a/DT third/JJ win./NN
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT shadow/NN hanging/VBG over/IN this/DT pre-election/JJ performance/NN -/: in/IN the/DT shape/NN of/IN Â£11/CD billion/CD or/CC thereabouts./NN
That/DT is/VBZ the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT financial/JJ "black/NN hole"/NN the/DT Tories/NNPS backed/VBD by/IN some/DT independent/JJ forecasters/NNS believe/VBP Mr/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO fill/VB with/IN tax/NN increases/NNS after/IN the/DT election./NN

The/DT opening/NN shot/NN in/IN that/DT battle/NN was/VBD fired/VBN at/IN the/DT weekend/NN with/IN claims/NNS a/DT Treasury/NNP leak/NN suggested/VBD Mr/NNP Brown/NNP was/VBD ready/JJ to/TO slap/VB capital/NN gains/NNS tax/NN on/IN home/NN sales/NNS to/TO raise/VB some/DT of/IN that/DT cash./NN
It/PRP was/VBD immediately/RB denied/VBN but/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS remain/VBP suspicious/JJ claiming/NN that/IN as/IN Mr/NNP Letwin/NNP said/VBD if/IN the/DT money/NN does/VBZ not/RB come/VBN from/IN there/EX where/WRB will/MD it/PRP come/VB from./NN

Mr/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD undoubtedly/RB claim/VB the/DT forecasts/NNS are/VBP simply/RB wrong/JJ and/CC that/IN he/PRP will/MD have/VB absolutely/RB no/DT need/NN to/TO raise/VB taxes/NNS after/IN the/DT election/NN should/MD Labour/NNP win./NN
Previous/JJ gloomy/JJ forecasts/NNS proved/VBD wrong/JJ he/PRP will/MD argue/VB while/IN suggesting/VBG that/IN only/RB by/IN sticking/VBG with/IN him/PRP can/MD Britain/NNP continue/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT sound/NN economy/NN low/JJ unemployment/NN and/CC high/JJ public/JJ spending./NN
The/DT opposition/NN will/MD reject/VB that/IN by/IN claiming/VBG they/PRP can/MD keep/VB the/DT economy/NN sound/NN increase/NN spending/NN and/CC cut/VB taxes/NNS at/IN the/DT same/JJ time./NN

The/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS will/MD also/RB promise/VB to/TO run/VB a/DT sound/NN economy/NN but/CC based/VBN on/IN increased/VBN taxes/NNS to/TO fund/VB spending/NN and/CC amongst/IN other/JJ things/NNS abolishing/VBG the/DT council/NN tax/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax./NN
And/CC there/EX will/MD be/VB prolonged/VBN argument/NN over/IN which/WDT of/IN the/DT parties/NNS can/MD make/VB the/DT greatest/JJS savings/NNS in/IN Whitehall/NNP and/CC beyond/IN to/TO fund/VB their/PRP$ policies./NN
But/CC probably/RB what/WP that/IN all/DT boils/NNS down/RB to/TO is/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ question/NN of/IN which/WDT of/IN the/DT parties/NNS the/DT voters/NNS most/JJS trust/NN to/TO keep/VB the/DT economy/NN stable/JJ and/CC avoid/VB any/DT unpleasant/JJ surprises/NNS in/IN the/DT coming/VBG years./NN
And/CC it/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB still/RB the/DT answer/NN to/TO that/DT one/CD question/NN that/WDT will/MD overwhelmingly/RB decide/VB the/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT general/JJ election./NN
