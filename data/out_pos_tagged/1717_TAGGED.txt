Ireland/NNP win/VBP eclipses/NNS refereeing/VBG 'errors'/NN

The/DT International/NNP Rugby/NNP Board/NNP may/MD have/VB to/TO step/VB in/RP to/TO stop/VB frustrated/JJ coaches/NNS and/CC players/NNS from/IN publicly/RB haranguing/VBG referees/NNS when/WRB things/NNS go/VBP belly-up./JJ

It/PRP may/MD have/VB to/TO go/VB the/DT whole/JJ way/NN and/CC have/VBP NFL-style/JJ video/NN cameras/NNS all/DT over/IN the/DT field/NN or/CC slap/VB the/DT vociferous/JJ perpetrators/NNS over/IN the/DT knuckles./NN
What/WP the/DT IRB/NNP does/VBZ not/RB want/VB is/VBZ a/DT football/NN scenario/NN where/WRB the/DT verbal/JJ slanging/NN matches/VBZ often/RB overshadow/VB the/DT game/NN itself./NN
Sunday's/NNP explosive/JJ Six/CD Nations/NNPS clash/NN at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ example/NN as/IN Ireland/NNP took/VBD another/DT step/NN towards/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP since/IN 1948./CD
The/DT game/NN was/VBD as/RB exciting/JJ as/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT much-improved/JJ England/NNP side/NN enraged/JJ at/IN a/DT few/JJ decisions/NNS that/WDT did/VBD not/RB go/VB their/PRP$ way./NN
One/CD can/MD understand/VB that/DT frustration./NN
There/EX was/VBD no/DT doubt/NN that/IN Ireland/NNP had/VBD the/DT rub/NN of/IN the/DT green/NN in/IN their/PRP$ 19-13/JJ victory/NN but/CC the/DT reaction/NN from/IN the/DT England/NNP camp/NN may/MD not/RB have/VB endeared/VBN them/PRP to/TO the/DT sport's/NNS "blazers"./NN
Referee/NNP Jonathan/NNP Kaplan/NNP was/VBD not/RB perfect/JJ by/IN any/DT means/NNS and/CC two/CD decisions/NNS in/IN particular/JJ made/VBN him/PRP the/DT villain/NN of/IN the/DT piece./NN
I/PRP doubt/VBP whether/IN Kaplan/NNP would/MD have/VB been/VBN too/RB pleased/VBN at/IN the/DT comments/NNS made./NN
After/IN all/DT he/PRP has/VBZ no/DT public/JJ recourse/NN to/TO criticism./VB

It/PRP was/VBD the/DT same/JJ for/IN Simon/NNP McDowell/NNP the/DT touch/NN judge/NN who/WP was/VBD heavily/RB criticised/VBN by/IN Scotland/NNP coach/NN Matt/NNP Williams/NNP after/IN their/PRP$ defeat/NN against/IN France./NNP
As/RB far/RB as/IN England/NNP were/VBD concerned/VBN there/EX were/VBD queries/NNS over/IN Mark/NNP Cueto's/NNP first/JJ half-effort/JJ when/WRB he/PRP went/VBD over/IN in/IN the/DT corner/NN from/IN a/DT Charlie/NNP Hodgson/NNP kick./NN

England/NNP coach/NN Andy/NNP Robinson/NNP referred/VBD to/TO a/DT similar/JJ case/NN at/IN Ravenhill/NNP in/IN January/NNP when/WRB Ulster/NNP were/VBD playing/VBG Gloucester/NNP in/IN the/DT Heineken/NNP Cup./NNP
On/IN that/DT occasion/NN David/NNP Humphreys/NNP kicked/VBD to/TO Tommy/NNP Bowe/NNP who/WP touched/VBD down/RP in/IN the/DT corner/NN only/RB for/IN the/DT try/NN to/TO be/VB wiped/VBN out./NN
But/CC you/PRP cannot/VBP have/VBP cameras/NNS at/IN every/DT conceivable/JJ angle/NN to/TO pick/VB up/RP such/JJ anomalies./NN
Perhaps/RB Robinson/NNP was/VBD right/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT referee/NN should/MD have/VB gone/VBN upstairs/NN when/WRB Josh/NNP Lewsey/NNP was/VBD driven/VBN over/IN the/DT Irish/JJ line/NN near/IN the/DT end./NN

Lewsey/NN claims/VBZ he/PRP touched/VBD it/PRP down/RP and/CC was/VBD in/IN full/JJ control./NN
However/RB one/CD has/VBZ to/TO credit/VB Ireland/NNP flanker/NN Johnny/NNP O'Connor/NNP for/IN cleverly/RB scooping/VBG the/DT ball/NN away/RB and/CC blocking/VBG any/DT evidence/NN of/IN a/DT touchdown./NN
But/CC in/IN rugby/NN everything/NN tends/VBZ to/TO even/RB out/IN over/IN the/DT 80/CD minutes./NN
The/DT referee/NN also/RB missed/VBD England's/NNP Danny/NNP Grewcock/NNP taking/VBG out/RP Ronan/NNP O'Gara/NNP off/RP the/DT ball/NN to/TO allow/VB Martin/NNP Corry/NNP a/DT Sunday/NNP stroll/NN to/TO the/DT line./NN
Those/DT were/VBD the/DT stand-out/JJ moments/NNS in/IN a/DT classic/JJ game/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD old/JJ foes./NN

But/CC there/EX were/VBD many/JJ more/JJR and/CC one/PRP should/MD not/RB take/VB away/RB from/IN those./NN
Brian/NNP O'Driscoll's/NNP winning/VBG try/NN was/VBD as/RB well-conceived/JJ as/IN they/PRP come/VBP while/IN Charlie/NNP Hodgson's/NNP brilliant/JJ kicking/NN display/NN was/VBD another/DT highlight./NN
And/CC Ronan/NNP O'Gara's/NNP tremendous/JJ ability/NN to/TO control/VB the/DT game/NN was/VBD also/RB a/DT crucial/JJ component./NN
But/CC the/DT defining/VBG moments/NNS came/VBD with/IN Ireland/NNP under/IN the/DT cosh/NN in/IN the/DT final/JJ 15/CD minutes./NN
Two/CD outstanding/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN defensive/JJ play/NN denied/VBD England/NNP and/CC allowed/VBD Ireland/NNP to/TO hold/VB on./NN
The/DT first/JJ was/VBD Denis/NNP Hickie's/NNP brilliant/JJ double/JJ tackle/NN in/IN the/DT right-hand/JJ corner./NN
He/PRP gobbled/VBD up/RP Cueto/NNP from/IN another/DT Hodgson/NNP cross-field/JJ kick/VBP then/RB regained/VBN his/PRP$ feet/NNS to/TO stop/VB Lewsey/NNP from/IN scoring/VBG a/DT certain/JJ try./NN
Ireland's/NNP second-row/JJ colossus/JJ Paul/NNP O'Connell/NNP was/VBD equally/RB superb./NN
England/NNP had/VBD turned/VBN Ireland/NNP one/CD way/NN then/RB the/DT other/JJ and/CC the/DT defence/NN cordon/NN was/VBD slowly/RB disintegrating./JJ
England/NNP prop/VB Matt/NNP Stevens/NNP ran/VBD in/IN at/IN full/JJ steam/NN to/TO suck/VB in/IN a/DT few/JJ more/JJR tacklers./NN
Unfortunately/RB he/PRP ran/VBD into/IN O'Connell/NNP who/WP hit/VBD him/PRP hard/JJ -/: very/RB hard/JJ -/: and/CC then/RB wrestled/VBN the/DT ball/NN away/RB for/IN a/DT crucial/JJ turnover./NN
That/DT spoke/VBD volumes/NNS about/IN Ireland's/NNP back-foot/JJ display/NN with/IN defensive/JJ coach/NN Mike/NNP Ford/NNP taking/VBG a/DT bow/NN at/IN the/DT end./NN
To/TO win/VB a/DT game/NN like/IN that/DT showed/VBD that/IN Ireland/NNP have/VBP moved/VBN forward./NN
It/PRP may/MD be/VB tries/VBZ that/WDT win/NN games/NNS but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ defence/NN that/WDT wins/VBZ championships./NN
