In/IN its/PRP$ quarterly/JJ economic/JJ review/NN Deloitte/NNP said/VBD the/DT UK/NNP economy/NN had/VBD enjoyed/VBN a/DT "golden/NN period"/NN during/IN the/DT past/JJ decade/NN with/IN unemployment/NN falling/VBG to/TO a/DT near/JJ 30/CD year/NN low/JJ and/CC inflation/NN at/IN its/PRP$ lowest/JJS since/IN the/DT 1960s./CD

Deloitte's/NNP chief/NN economic/JJ advisor/NN Roger/NNP Bootle/NNP said/VBD "The/NN biggest/JJS hit/VBD of/IN all/DT is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO come/VB from/IN the/DT housing/NN market/NN which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB embarked/VBN on/IN a/DT major/JJ slowdown./NN
