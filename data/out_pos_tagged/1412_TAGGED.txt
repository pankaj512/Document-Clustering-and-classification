But/CC Smith/NNP said/VBD "Bringing/VBG it/PRP back/RB would/MD add/VB meaning/VBG to/TO friendly/JJ games/NNS and/CC that's/NNS something/NN that's/NNS needed."/VBP The/DT Home/NNP International/NNP series/NN was/VBD done/VBN away/RB with/IN in/IN 1984/CD with/IN the/DT traditional/JJ Scotland-England/NNP fixture/NN continuing/VBG until/IN 1989./CD
That/DT game/NN is/VBZ one/CD Smith/NNP would/MD be/VB delighted/JJ to/TO see/VB reinstated./NN
"The/NNP Scotland/NNP v/NN England/NNP match/VB was/VBD a/DT highlight/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT season"/NN he/PRP added./VB

If/IN you/PRP don't/VBP they/PRP can/MD be/VB de-motivating./JJ
"It/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT dangerous/JJ road/NN to/TO go/VB down/RP if/IN players/NNS don't/NN apply/VBP themselves/PRP in/IN the/DT manner/NN they/PRP should./VBP
"So/NN I/PRP would/MD support/VB the/DT return/NN of/IN the/DT home/NN internationals/NNS -/: the/DT only/JJ problem/NN would/MD be/VB fitting/JJ them/PRP in/RP to/TO the/DT fixture/NN schedule."/NN
