Ministers/NNS 'naive'/NN over/IN phone-taps/NNS

The/DT government/NN is/VBZ being/VBG naive/JJ by/IN refusing/VBG to/TO allow/VB phone-tap/JJ evidence/NN in/IN court/NN a/DT senior/JJ EU/NNP politician/NN says./NN

Javier/NNP Solana/NNP EU/NNP foreign/JJ policy/NN chief/NN says/VBZ phone-tap/JJ evidence/NN works/VBZ in/IN the/DT courts/NNS of/IN other/JJ European/JJ countries./NN
Human/NN rights/NNS groups/NNS top/JJ police/NN officers/NNS and/CC many/JJ MPs/NNP say/VBP allowing/VBG the/DT evidence/NN would/MD remove/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO detain/VB terror/NN suspects/VBZ without/IN charge./NN
But/CC Home/NNP Secretary/NNP Charles/NNP Clarke/NNP says/VBZ the/DT evidence/NN would/MD not/RB make/VB much/JJ difference/NN to/TO these/DT cases./NN
Mr/NNP Solana/NNP told/VBD ITV1's/CD Jonathan/NNP Dimbleby/NNP programme/NN "[Phone-tap/JJ evidence/NN in/IN court]/NN works/VBZ it/PRP is/VBZ normal/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN it/PRP would/MD be/VB naive/JJ not/RB to/TO do/VB it./NN
"It/NN would/MD be/VB naive/JJ not/RB to/TO use/VB this/DT technological/JJ thing/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP at/IN our/PRP$ disposal."/JJ Mr/NNP Solana's/NNP comments/NNS come/VBP the/DT day/NN after/IN Sir/NNP Ian/NNP Blair/NNP the/DT newly-appointed/JJ Metropolitan/NNP Police/NNP commissioner/NN said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN phone-tap/JJ evidence./NN

Under/IN the/DT Anti-Terrorism/NNP Crimes/NNS and/CC Security/NNP Act/NNP 2001/CD foreign/JJ terror/NN suspects/VBZ can/MD be/VB detained/VBN in/IN British/JJ jails/NNS without/IN trial/NN or/CC charge./NN
Several/JJ suspects/VBZ have/VBP been/VBN detained/VBN under/IN these/DT powers/NNS because/IN evidence/NN against/IN them/PRP was/VBD deemed/VBN too/RB sensitive/JJ to/TO be/VB heard/VBN in/IN court./NN

Some/DT of/IN this/DT evidence/NN is/VBZ believed/VBN to/TO be/VB telephone/NN intercepts./JJ
Human/NNP Rights/NNP group/NN Liberty/NNP has/VBZ argued/VBN that/IN if/IN intercept/JJ evidence/NN could/MD be/VB heard/VBN these/DT detainees/NNS could/MD be/VB brought/VBN to/TO trial./VB
But/CC critics/NNS of/IN phone-tap/JJ trials/NNS say/VBP the/DT evidence/NN is/VBZ often/RB weak/JJ and/CC can/MD expose/VB the/DT methods/NNS of/IN the/DT security/NN services./NN
The/DT home/NN secretary/NN says/VBZ intercepts/NNS would/MD not/RB make/VB much/JJ difference/NN because/IN cases/NNS against/IN terror/NN suspects/VBZ frequently/RB rely/VB on/IN other/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN surveillance./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Clarke/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN forced/VBN to/TO change/VB the/DT regime/NN of/IN detention/NN without/IN trial/NN after/IN Law/NNP Lords/NNPS ruled/VBD it/PRP illegal./NN
He/PRP has/VBZ opted/VBN for/IN a/DT system/NN of/IN "control/NN orders"/NN whereby/WRB suspects/VBZ both/DT British/JJ and/CC foreign/JJ can/MD be/VB held/VBN under/IN house/NN arrest/NN or/CC surveillance./NN
These/DT orders/NNS will/MD again/RB involve/VB a/DT UK/NNP opt-out/JJ of/IN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT European/NNP Convention/NNP on/IN Human/NNP Rights./NNP
While/IN accepting/VBG that/IN people/NNS "have/VBP to/TO be/VB prepared"/NN for/IN a/DT possible/JJ terrorist/JJ attack/NN Mr/NNP Solana/NNP said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD "qualms"/NN about/IN the/DT home/NN secretary's/VBZ new/JJ plans./NN
"We/NN have/VBP to/TO fight/VB terrorism/NN with/IN all/DT our/PRP$ means/NNS but/CC not/RB so/RB far/RB as/IN to/TO change/VB our/PRP$ way/NN of/IN life"/NN he/PRP said./VB
