While/IN the/DT awards/NNS are/VBP not/RB based/VBN on/IN box/NN office/NN popularity/NN there/EX is/VBZ concern/NN for/IN the/DT ratings/NNS of/IN the/DT televised/VBN ceremony./NN
"We/NN don't/NN have/VBP a/DT Titanic/NNP or/CC a/DT Lord/NNP of/IN the/DT Rings/NNS out/RP there./NN
I/PRP think/VBP it's/NNS fair/JJ to/TO say/VB it/PRP does/VBZ concern/NN us/PRP a/DT bit"/NN said/VBD Academy/NNP executive/NN director/NN Bruce/NNP Davis./NNP
About/IN 51/CD million/CD people/NNS in/IN the/DT US/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN this/DT year's/NNS nominees/NNS compared/VBN with/IN between/IN 100/CD million/CD and/CC 118/CD million/CD in/IN recent/JJ years./NN
The/DT last/JJ time/NN combined/VBD attendance/NN was/VBD so/RB low/RB was/VBD in/IN 1984/CD when/WRB Amadeus/NNP beat/VB The/DT Killing/VBG Fields/NNP A/NNP Passage/NN to/TO India/NNP Places/NNPS in/IN the/DT Heart/NNP and/CC A/DT Soldier's/NNP Story/NNP to/TO best/JJS picture/NN when/WRB 41/CD million/CD saw/VBD the/DT five/CD films./NN

And/CC the/DT show/NN reaped/VBD its/PRP$ biggest/JJS audience/NN in/IN 1997/CD when/WRB Titanic/NNP took/VBD home/NN 11/CD Oscars./NNP

The/DT film/NN had/VBD taken/VBN $500m/CD (£264m)/CD worldwide/NN before/IN the/DT ceremony/NN and/CC eventually/RB took/VBD $1.8bn/CD (£952m)./CD
"Eyeballs/NN starring/VBG at/IN the/DT movie/NN screen/NN translates/NNS to/TO eyeballs/NNS staring/VBG at/IN the/DT TV/NN screen"/NN said/VBD Paul/NNP Dergarabedian/NNP of/IN box/NN office/NN tracker/NN Exhibitor/NNP Relations./NNP
"People/NN like/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT vested/VBN interest/NN in/IN what/WP they're/NN watching./NN

The/DT biggest/JJS box/NN office/NN hitter/NN among/IN this/DT year's/NNS nominees/NNS is/VBZ The/DT Aviator/NNP which/WDT has/VBZ taken/VBN $90m/CD (£48m)/CD in/IN the/DT US/PRP although/IN takings/NNS in/IN the/DT UK/NNP have/VBP reached/VBN only/RB £7m/CD so/RB far./NN

Low-budget/JJ move/NN Sideways/RB and/CC Finding/VBG Neverland/NNP have/VBP so/RB far/RB grossed/VBN about/IN $45m/CD (£24m)/CD each./NN
The/DT year's/NNS biggest/JJS blockbusters/NNS do/VBP actually/RB feature/NN in/IN the/DT Oscar/NNP nominees/NNS but/CC in/IN the/DT animation/NN category./NN

But/CC many/JJ in/IN the/DT film/NN industry/NN do/VBP not/RB equate/VB award/NN and/CC box/NN office/NN success./NN
"I/NN have/VBP never/RB equated/VBN the/DT Academy/NNP Awards/NNS with/IN how/WRB much/JJ money/NN a/DT movie/NN takes/VBZ in"/NN said/VBD Nikki/NNP Rocco/NNP head/NN of/IN distribution/NN at/IN Universal/NNP which/WDT released/VBD nominee/NN Ray./NNP
