"The/NN difficult/JJ moments/NNS were/VBD when/WRB I/PRP knew/VBD that/IN I/PRP had/VBD the/DT chicken/NN pox/NN and/CC that/IN it/PRP would/MD take/VB two/CD or/CC three/CD months/NNS to/TO recover./VB
"I/NN had/VBD to/TO start/VB from/IN zero/CD again/RB physically/RB because/IN the/DT virus/NN left/VBD me/PRP at/IN zero/CD per/IN cent./NN
