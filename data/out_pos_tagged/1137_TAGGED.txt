Authorities/NNS will/MD decide/VB final/JJ figures/NNS on/IN Thursday/NNP when/WRB projected/VBN increases/NNS will/MD be/VB more/JJR than/IN twice/RB the/DT rate/NN of/IN inflation/NN which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB 1.6%./CD
The/DT finance/NN minister/NN has/VBZ urged/VBN councils/NNS to/TO limit/VB increases/NNS but/CC they/PRP have/VBP warned/VBN that/IN they/PRP will/MD struggle/VB to/TO maintain/VB services/NNS unless/IN funding/NN is/VBZ increased./NN
They/PRP say/VBP much/JJ additional/JJ government/NN money/NN is/VBZ for/IN new/JJ initiatives./NN
Scottish/NNP Finance/NNP Minister/NNP Tom/NNP McCabe/NNP MSP/NNP said/VBD "Last/NN week/NN in/IN parliament/NN I/PRP announced/VBD an/DT additional/JJ £419m/CD for/IN core/NN expenditure/NN to/TO local/JJ government/NN in/IN Scotland./NNP
"That's/NN a/DT 5.5%/CD increase/NN and/CC sits/VBZ against/IN an/DT inflation/NN rate/NN of/IN 1.6%/CD so/IN I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP quite/RB rightly/RB said/VBD to/TO councils/NNS this/DT year/NN that/IN we/PRP would/MD at/IN the/DT very/RB least/JJS ask/VB them/PRP to/TO exercise/VB restraint."/NN Mr/NNP McCabe/NNP is/VBZ also/RB looking/VBG for/IN local/JJ authorities/NNS to/TO become/VB more/RBR efficient/JJ and/CC save/VB money/NN in/IN coming/VBG years./NN
He/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP Scotland's/NNP Sunday/NNP Live/JJ programme/NN "Here/NN in/IN Scotland/NNP we/PRP have/VBP 32/CD councils/NNS who/WP all/DT have/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ individual/JJ collection/NN systems/NNS for/IN council/NN tax/NN they/PRP have/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ payroll/NN systems/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ own/JJ human/JJ resource/NN systems./NN

"We/NN think/VBP there/EX has/VBZ to/TO be/VB opportunities/NNS there/RB for/IN rationalisation/NN and/CC using/VBG the/DT money/NN saved/VBN to/TO reinvest/VB in/IN frontline/NN services."/NN The/DT councils'/NN umbrella/NN organisation/NN Cosla/NNP which/WDT provided/VBD BBC/NNP Scotland/NNP with/IN the/DT indicative/JJ figures/NNS for/IN next/JJ year/NN warned/VBD that/IN councils/NNS would/MD face/VB a/DT continuous/JJ struggle/NN to/TO maintain/VB services./NN
Mr/NNP McCabe/NNP has/VBZ promised/VBN them/PRP about/IN £8.1bn/CD next/JJ year./NN
"However/NN most/JJS of/IN the/DT increase/NN is/VBZ targeted/VBN to/TO new/JJ initiatives/NNS and/CC councils/NNS will/MD experience/VB difficulties/NNS in/IN maintaining/VBG core/NN services"/NN a/DT Cosla/NNP spokesman/NN said./NN
Cosla/NNP says/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO work/VB with/IN the/DT executive/NN on/IN finding/VBG efficiency/NN savings/NNS but/CC that/IN these/DT will/MD not/RB be/VB enough/RB to/TO maintain/VB services./NN
They/PRP say/VBP the/DT funding/NN plans/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ three/CD years/NNS will/MD see/VB councils/NNS lose/VBP more/JJR of/IN the/DT share/NN of/IN public/JJ spending./NN
The/DT Conservatives/NNS accuse/VBP the/DT Scottish/NNP Executive/NNP of/IN using/VBG the/DT council/NN tax/NN to/TO raise/VB funds/NNS because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB afraid/JJ to/TO raise/VB income/NN tax./NN

The/DT Tory/NNP finance/NN spokesman/NN Brian/NNP Monteith/NNP MSP/NNP said/VBD "Its/NN a/DT form/NN of/IN disguise.../JJ
yet/RB again/RB we/PRP see/VBP that/DT council/NN tax/NN is/VBZ being/VBG used/VBN as/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN passing/VBG on/IN costs./NN

"The/NN settlement/NN figures/NNS don't/NN include/VBP pay/VB increases/NNS and/CC the/DT executive/NN is/VBZ also/RB requiring/VBG a/DT substantial/JJ figure/NN -/: in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN £325m/CD -/: in/IN efficiency/NN savings/NNS across/IN the/DT settlement/NN period."/NN Education/NNP will/MD be/VB protected/VBN from/IN any/DT cuts/NNS but/CC Linda/NNP Knox/NNP says/VBZ this/DT will/MD mean/VB other/JJ services/NNS will/MD suffer./VB

On/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN it/PRP the/DT settlement/NN looks/VBZ like/IN an/DT increase/NN of/IN about/IN 9.7%/CD but/CC by/IN the/DT time/NN you/PRP take/VBP into/IN account/NN other/JJ factors/NNS its/PRP$ probably/RB only/RB about/IN 1%/CD in/IN real/JJ terms."/NN
