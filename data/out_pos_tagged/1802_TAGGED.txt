Newly-crowned/JJ Australian/JJ Open/NNP champion/NN Marat/NNP Safin/NNP has/VBZ ruled/VBN out/RP any/DT chance/NN of/IN winning/VBG Wimbledon/NNP in/IN the/DT future./NN

After/IN losing/VBG in/IN round/NN one/CD last/JJ year/NN Safin/NNP said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD "given/NN up"/NN on/IN Wimbledon/NNP and/CC winning/VBG his/PRP$ second/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP title/NN has/VBZ not/RB changed/VBN his/PRP$ mind./NN
"I'll/NN play/NN but/CC with/IN no/DT expectations./NN
I/PRP feel/VBP like/IN I/PRP can't/VBP waste/NN my/PRP$ time/NN my/PRP$ energy/NN on/IN that/DT surface"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"Some/NN people/NNS they/PRP cannot/VBP play/NN on/IN clay./NN
Some/DT people/NNS they/PRP cannot/VBP play/NN on/IN a/DT hard/JJ court./NN
Me/PRP I/PRP can't/VBP play/NN on/IN grass."/NN However/RB Safin/NNP is/VBZ hopeful/JJ that/IN winning/VBG the/DT Australian/JJ Open/NNP will/MD give/VB him/PRP the/DT belief/NN he/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO win/VB more/JJR Grand/NNP Slam/NNP titles./NN
"It's/NN a/DT relief/NN for/IN me./NN
Two/CD grand/JJ slams/NNS it's/NNS already/RB something./VBP
But/CC with/IN this/DT one/CD I/PRP worked/VBD really/RB hard/RB for/IN it"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"Basically/RB I/PRP would/MD love/VB to/TO win/VB a/DT couple/NN more./NN
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP have/VBP a/DT chance/NN if/IN I/PRP continue/VBP this/DT way./NN

"If/NN (coach)/NN Peter/NNP Lundgren/NNP will/MD stick/VB around/IN with/IN me/PRP and/CC wants/VBZ to/TO work/VB with/IN me/PRP for/IN a/DT bit/NN longer/RB I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP can/MD make/VB it."/NN The/DT 25-year-old/NN shocked/VBD Pete/NNP Sampras/NNP in/IN the/DT 2000/CD US/PRP Open/NNP final/JJ to/TO win/VB his/PRP$ first/JJ major/JJ title/NN but/CC then/RB lost/VBD in/IN two/CD Australian/JJ Open/NNP finals./NN
Safin/NNP admitted/VBD he/PRP had/VBD begun/VBN to/TO doubt/VB whether/IN he/PRP would/MD win/VB another/DT Grand/NNP Slam./NNP
"I/NN didn't/NN expect/VBP that/DT (to/NN win/VBP the/DT 2000/CD US/PRP Open)/NNP -/: it/PRP was/VBD against/IN Sampras/NNP I/PRP wasn't/VBP the/DT favourite/NN so/IN I/PRP had/VBD no/DT pressure/NN whatsoever"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"After/NN the/DT first/JJ final/NN that/IN I/PRP didn't/VBP win/NN against/IN Thomas/NNP Johansson/NNP (in/NN 2002)/CD I/PRP couldn't/VBP see/NN myself/PRP winning/VBG the/DT Grand/NNP Slams/NNP anymore./NN
"I/NN was/VBD once/RB in/IN the/DT semi-finals/NNS of/IN the/DT French/JJ Open/NNP but/CC I/PRP didn't/VBP believe/VBP I/PRP can/MD win/VB it./NN
"I/NN just/RB couldn't/NN handle/VBP the/DT pressure./NN
You/PRP need/VBP to/TO believe/VB in/IN yourself/PRP and/CC I/PRP didn't."/VBP

And/CC after/IN losing/VBG the/DT first/JJ set/VBN 6-1/JJ to/TO Lleyton/NNP Hewitt/NNP in/IN Sunday's/NNP final/JJ Safin/NNP said/VBD he/PRP began/VBD to/TO doubt/VB himself/PRP again./VBP
"I/NN am/VBP 25./CD
I'm/NNP playing/VBG against/IN Hewitt./NNP
At/IN least/JJS you/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO win/VB it/PRP at/IN least/JJS have/VBP a/DT chance"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"It's/NN like/IN you/PRP go/VBP there/RB and/CC you/PRP lose/VBP first/RB set/VBN 6-1/JJ then/RB you/PRP start/VBP to/TO think/VB 'This/NN is/VBZ not/RB my/PRP$ day./NN
The/DT way/NN I'm/NNP playing/NN is/VBZ ridiculous.'/NN "But/NN then/RB you/PRP start/VBP to/TO really/RB be/VB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN more/RBR selfish/JJ and/CC try/VB to/TO find/VB a/DT way/NN out/IN of/IN there./NN
"And/NN I/PRP found/VBD it./NN
I/PRP was/VBD like/IN really/RB much/JJ I/PRP was/VBD much/RB happier/JJR than/IN in/IN 2000/CD that's/NNS for/IN sure/JJ because/IN I/PRP get/VBP over/IN it."/NN
