Back/RB under/IN the/DT spotlight/NN of/IN public/JJ scrutiny/NN she/PRP will/MD attempt/VB to/TO erase/VB the/DT double/JJ disappointment/NN of/IN the/DT Athens/NNP Olympics/NNPS where/WRB she/PRP failed/VBD to/TO finish/VB the/DT marathon/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT 10000m./CD
BBC/NNP Sport/NNP examines/VBZ the/DT challenges/NNS facing/VBG Radcliffe/NNP ahead/RB of/IN the/DT big/JJ race./NN


The/DT ability/NN to/TO run/VB a/DT gruelling/VBG 26.2/CD miles/NNS relies/VBZ largely/RB upon/IN an/DT athlete's/NNS belief/NN that/IN they/PRP can/MD do/VB it./NN
Every/DT runner/NN will/MD hit/VB the/DT wall/NN at/IN some/DT stage/NN and/CC see/VB written/VBN on/IN it/PRP "Are/NN you/PRP strong/JJ enough/RB to/TO finish?"/VB

The/DT question/NN could/MD hit/VB Radcliffe/NNP hard/RB after/IN she/PRP was/VBD unable/JJ to/TO complete/VB her/PRP$ last/JJ two/CD races/NNS in/IN high-profile/JJ and/CC emotional/JJ circumstances./NN
Sports/NNP psychologist/NN Hugh/NNP Richards/NNP says/VBZ the/DT 30-year-old/NN must/MD draw/VB on/IN her/PRP$ past/JJ achievements/NNS to/TO conquer/VB a/DT potential/JJ crisis/NN of/IN confidence./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ an/DT old/JJ adage/NN 'get/NN straight/JJ back/RB on/IN the/DT horse/NN that/WDT threw/VBD you'"/NN Richards/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Sport./NNP
"Paula/NN has/VBZ got/VBD all/PDT those/DT great/JJ runs/NNS in/IN her/PRP$ history/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT two/CD upsets/NNS in/IN Athens./NNP
"She/NN must/MD not/RB lose/VB faith/NN in/IN what/WP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN proven/VBN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB effective/JJ strategy/NN for/IN distance/NN running./NN
"If/NN she/PRP were/VBD to/TO change/VB her/PRP$ preparation/NN and/CC tactics/NNS that/WDT would/MD be/VB madness./NN
"She/NN wants/VBZ to/TO start/VB rebuilding/VBG her/PRP$ confidence/NN through/IN performance/NN accomplishment."/NN

For/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT watching/VBG media/NNS and/CC public/JJ there/EX can/MD only/RB be/VB two/CD possible/JJ outcomes/NNS in/IN New/NNP York/NNP -/: win/VB or/CC lose./NN
If/IN Radcliffe/NNP crosses/VBZ the/DT line/NN first/RB she/PRP will/MD have/VB proved/VBN her/PRP$ critics/NNS wrong./NN
But/CC if/IN she/PRP fails/VBZ to/TO triumph/VB she/PRP risks/VBZ being/VBG labelled/VBN a/DT has-been/JJ and/CC her/PRP$ profile/NN will/MD suffer./VB
And/CC for/IN any/DT athlete/NN that/WDT can/MD have/VB repercussions/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN sponsorship/NN appearance/NN fees/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN further/JJ self/NN esteem/NN issues./NN

"Athletes/NN need/VBP to/TO try/VB and/CC stay/VB focused/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ internal/JJ controls/NNS and/CC ignore/VB external/JJ questions"/NN explains/VBZ Richards/NNP who/WP has/VBZ worked/VBN with/IN past/JJ Olympians./NNP
"She/NN must/MD not/RB get/VB caught/VBN up/RP in/IN someone/NN else's/NNS agenda."/NN Radcliffe's/NNP best/JJS friend/NN and/CC fellow/JJ distance/NN runner/NN Liz/NNP Yelling/VBG revealed/VBD the/DT 30-year-old/JJ is/VBZ already/RB aware/JJ she/PRP will/MD be/VB exposing/VBG herself/PRP to/TO more/RBR public/JJ scrutiny/NN in/IN New/NNP York./NNP
"She/NN just/RB thought/VBD 'well/NN they/PRP can't/VBP think/VBP any/DT worse/JJR of/IN me/PRP now'"/VBP Yelling/VBG told/VBD BBC/NNP Sport./NNP
"She's/NN just/RB doing/VBG what/WP she/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO do/VB and/CC not/RB thinking/VBG about/IN the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN it."/NN

Radcliffe/NNP described/VBD her/PRP$ decision/NN to/TO enter/VB the/DT New/NNP York/NNP marathon/NN as/IN "impulsive"/NN but/CC she/PRP is/VBZ certain/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT tick-list/NN of/IN personal/JJ goals./NN
Her/PRP$ aims/NNS could/MD be/VB as/RB simple/JJ as/IN completing/VBG a/DT race/NN and/CC making/VBG sure/JJ she/PRP is/VBZ still/RB enjoying/VBG running/VBG but/CC Richards/NNP says/VBZ she/PRP must/MD avoid/VB more/RBR emotional/JJ targets/NNS such/JJ as/IN redemption./NN
"You/NN can't/NN change/NN history"/NN warned/VBD Richards./NNP
"Only/RB one/CD person/NN can/MD win/VB the/DT marathon/NN but/CC lots/NNS of/IN people/NNS can/MD be/VB successful./NN
"Paula/NN has/VBZ to/TO figure/VB out/RP what/WP sort/NN of/IN things/NNS will/MD she/PRP feel/VB satisfied/VBN achieving/VBG by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT race."/NN

The/DT course/NN from/IN Staten/NNP Island/NNP to/TO Central/NNP Park/NNP is/VBZ renowned/JJ as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT toughest/JJS in/IN the/DT world./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB not/RB the/DT kind/NN of/IN fast/RB course/NN that/WDT tends/VBZ to/TO suit/VB Radcliffe/NNP better/JJR with/IN the/DT undulating/VBG finish/NN through/IN the/DT park/NN testing/NN the/DT legs'/NN final/JJ reserves./NN

Radcliffe/NNP has/VBZ never/RB raced/VBN there/RB before/IN and/CC will/MD enter/VB the/DT unknown/JJ just/RB 77/CD days/NNS after/IN the/DT Athens/NNP marathon./NN
"It's/NN suggested/VBD after/IN a/DT major/JJ marathon/NN you/PRP take/VBP a/DT full/JJ month/NN off/IN and/CC start/VB building/NN up/RP again"/NN said/VBD Yelling/VBG herself/PRP a/DT marathon/NN runner./NN
"But/NN that/DT is/VBZ only/RB for/IN long-term/JJ health/NN and/CC fitness./NN
"When/NN you/PRP finish/VBP a/DT marathon/NN you/PRP are/VBP still/RB very/RB fit/VB and/CC can/MD recover/VB quickly./NN
So/RB physically/RB it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ for/IN Paula."/NNP Richards/NNP also/RB points/VBZ out/RP conditions/NNS in/IN New/NNP York/NNP will/MD be/VB more/RBR conducive/JJ to/TO a/DT strong/JJ physical/JJ display/NN from/IN Radcliffe./NNP
"The/NN heat/NN stress/NN was/VBD the/DT primary/JJ factor/NN that/WDT tripped/VBD her/PRP up/RP in/IN Athens"/NNP he/PRP said./VB
"And/NN that/IN just/RB isn't/NN going/VBG to/TO be/VB there/RB in/IN New/NNP York/NNP that's/NNS been/VBN taken/VBN out/IN of/IN the/DT equation."/NN



Radcliffe/NNP concedes/VBZ she/PRP will/MD probably/RB learn/VB a/DT lot/NN from/IN her/PRP$ bad/JJ experiences/NNS in/IN Athens/NNP in/IN time./NN
And/CC Richards/NNP and/CC Yelling/VBG agree/VBP she/PRP could/MD turn/VB the/DT trauma/NN to/TO her/PRP$ advantage/NN starting/VBG in/IN New/NNP York./NNP
"How/NN you/PRP respond/VBP to/TO adversity/NN is/VBZ what/WP marks/NNS you/PRP out/RP as/IN elite/NN or/CC not"/NN argues/VBZ Richards./NNP

"One/NN of/IN the/DT challenges/NNS of/IN massive/JJ set/VBN backs/VBZ is/VBZ how/WRB you/PRP turn/VBP them/PRP into/IN opportunities."/NN And/CC Yelling/VBG says/VBZ "I/NN think/VBP this/DT will/MD probably/RB make/VB Paula."/NNP "I/NN think/VBP it/PRP will/MD drive/VB her/PRP on/IN and/CC she'll/NN come/VBP out/IN of/IN it/PRP a/DT better/JJR athlete."/NN
