He/PRP will/MD be/VB without/IN a/DT host/NN of/IN big/JJ names/NNS for/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS as/IN the/DT intensity/NN of/IN professional/JJ rugby/NN union/NN hits/NNS players./NN

"I/NN think/VBP players/NNS are/VBP probably/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB three/CD or/CC four/CD years/NNS taken/VBD off/RP their/PRP$ careers."/NN Robinson/NNP will/MD be/VB missing/VBG an/DT entire/JJ midfield/NN for/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS with/IN the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Jonny/NNP Wilkinson/NNP Mike/NNP Tindall/NNP and/CC Will/MD Greenwood/NNP injured./NN

Rugby/NNP union/NN has/VBZ become/VBN far/RB more/RBR physically/RB demanding/VBG since/IN the/DT game/NN went/VBD professional/JJ nearly/RB 10/CD years/NNS ago./NN
As/IN a/DT result/NN three/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ stakeholders/NNS in/IN English/JJ rugby/NN have/VBP launched/VBN an/DT "injury/NN audit"/NN to/TO find/VB out/RP how/WRB players/NNS are/VBP coping./NN
