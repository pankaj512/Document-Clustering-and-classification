'Fido'/NN to/TO be/VB taken/VBN off/RP vote/NN lists/NNS

The/DT risk/NN of/IN pets/NNS and/CC children/NNS being/VBG given/VBN votes/NNS could/MD be/VB cut/VBN by/IN changing/VBG how/WRB people/NNS register/VBP to/TO vote/VB the/DT UK/NNP elections/NNS watchdog/NN has/VBZ said./NN

Those/DT are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT mistakes/NNS found/VBD under/IN the/DT current/JJ system/NN where/WRB one/CD person/NN in/IN each/DT household/NN applies/VBZ for/IN voting/VBG forms/NNS for/IN the/DT other/JJ occupants./NN
The/DT Electoral/JJ Commission/NNP says/VBZ enabling/VBG people/NNS to/TO register/VB individually/RB could/MD cut/VB some/DT errors/NNS and/CC combat/NN fraud./NN
Voters/NNS need/VBP to/TO register/VB by/IN 11/CD March/NNP if/IN the/DT next/JJ poll/NN is/VBZ on/IN 5/CD May/NNP as/IN expected./NN
But/CC any/DT individual/JJ registration/NN scheme/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB introduced/VBN in/IN Britain/NNP before/IN that/DT general/JJ election./NN

The/DT proposed/VBN scheme/NN would/MD mean/VB voters/NNS using/VBG individual/JJ "identifiers"/NN when/WRB they/PRP vote/VBP -/: such/JJ as/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ voting/NN number/NN date/NN of/IN birth/NN and/CC signature./NN
The/DT Electoral/JJ Commission/NNP says/VBZ having/VBG voters/NNS register/VBP individually/RB rather/RB than/IN the/DT head/NN of/IN household/NN do/VBP it/PRP for/IN them/PRP fits/VBZ better/JJR with/IN human/JJ rights/NNS laws./NN
Chairman/NNP Sam/NNP Younger/JJR told/VBD MPs/NNP on/IN Tuesday/NNP care/NN was/VBD needed/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN people/NNS were/VBD not/RB lost/VBN off/RP the/DT register/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN -/: which/WDT happened/VBD when/WRB Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP switched/VBD to/TO a/DT similar/JJ system./NN
There/EX have/VBP been/VBN rare/JJ cases/NNS when/WRB household/NN pets/NNS have/VBP been/VBN put/VBN on/IN the/DT electoral/JJ roll/NN the/DT MPs/NNP heard./NN
And/CC some/DT people/NNS have/VBP registered/VBN all/DT their/PRP$ family/NN regardless/RB of/IN their/PRP$ age/NN -/: birth/NN dates/NNS are/VBP not/RB included/VBN on/IN the/DT forms/NNS so/RB election/VBP officers/NNS cannot/NN easily/RB check./NN
Non-British/NN citizens/NNS who/WP are/VBP not/RB entitled/VBN to/TO vote/VB have/VBP also/RB been/VBN registered/VBN in/IN some/DT cases./NN

Mr/NNP Younger/JJR said/VBD there/EX was/VBD anecdotal/JJ evidence/NN of/IN inaccuracies/NNS in/IN the/DT register/NN the/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN which/WDT were/VBD caused/VBN by/IN genuine/JJ mistakes./NN
He/PRP argued/VBD local/JJ councils/NNS could/MD look/VB harder/RBR at/IN promoting/VBG targeted/VBN campaigns/NNS at/IN "hard/NN to/TO reach"/VB voters/NNS for/IN example./NN
Some/DT authorities/NNS already/RB run/VBP such/JJ programmes/NNS but/CC in/IN others/NNS councillors/NNS worry/VBP about/IN the/DT party/NN political/JJ impact/NN of/IN encouraging/VBG particular/JJ areas/NNS to/TO turn/VB out./NN
Mr/NNP Younger/JJR said/VBD using/VBG the/DT Royal/NNP Mail's/NNP postal/JJ redirection/NN service/NN had/VBD already/RB helped/VBN election/NN officers/NNS retrace/NN about/IN 50000/CD voters./NN

He/PRP argued/VBD individual/JJ registration/NN would/MD also/RB increase/VB security/NN for/IN postal/JJ ballots/NNS and/CC other/JJ new/JJ ways/NNS of/IN voting./NN
There/EX have/VBP been/VBN fears/NNS there/RB are/VBP too/RB few/JJ checks/NNS to/TO ensure/VB current/JJ postal/JJ votes/NNS are/VBP cast/NN by/IN the/DT person/NN on/IN the/DT voting/NN form./NN
He/PRP said/VBD it/PRP might/MD also/RB help/VB register/VB students/NNS in/IN halls/NNS of/IN residences/NNS where/WRB the/DT hall/NN warden/NN often/RB has/VBZ to/TO do/VB the/DT job/NN for/IN everybody./NN
The/DT MPs/NNP on/IN the/DT Office/NNP of/IN the/DT Deputy/NNP Prime/NNP Minister/NNP and/CC Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNP select/VBP committees/NNS pressed/VBD Mr/NNP Younger/JJR on/IN how/WRB to/TO avoid/VB losing/VBG voters/NNS in/IN any/DT changeover./NN
He/PRP said/VBD the/DT Northern/NNP Ireland/NNP example/NN illustrated/VBD real/JJ difficulties/NNS to/TO be/VB confronted./NN
Currently/RB British/JJ voters/NNS have/VBP to/TO re-register/JJ to/TO vote/VB every/DT year/NN or/CC face/NN being/VBG removed/VBN from/IN the/DT electoral/JJ rolls/NNS if/IN they/PRP fail/VBP to/TO do/VB so/RB two/CD years/NNS running./NN
Mr/NNP Younger/JJR suggested/VBD the/DT re-registration/NN could/MD happen/VB less/RBR frequently/RB but/CC argued/VBD efforts/NNS were/VBD needed/VBN to/TO check/VB the/DT electoral/JJ rolls/NNS were/VBD up-to-date./JJ
