The/DT chancellor's/NNS announcement/NN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD to/TO offer/VB a/DT £200/CD council/NN tax/NN rebate/NN paid/VBN by/IN pensioner/NN households/NNS was/VBD merely/RB a/DT "sticking/VBG plaster"/NN to/TO a/DT much/RB bigger/JJR problem./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dem/NNP plan/NN for/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax/NN would/MD benefit/VB the/DT typical/JJ household/NN by/IN more/JJR than/IN £450/CD a/DT year/NN with/IN half/NN of/IN all/DT pensioners/NNS paying/VBG no/DT local/JJ tax/NN and/CC about/IN three/CD million/CD being/VBG better/JJR off./NN

The/DT chancellor/NN went/VBD on/RP to/TO put/VB up/RP National/NNP Insurance/NNP contributions/NNS after/IN the/DT election./NN
