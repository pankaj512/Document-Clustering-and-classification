TV/NN debate/NN urged/VBD for/IN party/NN chiefs/NNS

Broadcasters/NNS should/MD fix/VB a/DT date/NN for/IN a/DT pre-election/JJ televised/VBN debate/NN between/IN the/DT three/CD main/JJ political/JJ leaders/NNS according/VBG to/TO the/DT Hansard/NNP Society./NNP

It/PRP would/MD then/RB be/VB up/RP to/TO Tony/NNP Blair/NNP Michael/NNP Howard/NNP and/CC Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP to/TO decide/VB whether/IN to/TO take/VB part/NN the/DT non-partisan/JJ charity/NN said./NN
Chairman/NNP Lord/NNP Holme/NNP argued/VBD that/IN prime/JJ ministers/NNS should/MD not/RB have/VB the/DT right/NN of/IN veto/NN on/IN a/DT matter/NN "of/NN public/JJ interest"./JJ
"The/NN broadcasters/NNS should/MD make/VB the/DT decision/NN to/TO go/VB ahead"/NN he/PRP said./VB

Lord/NNP Holme's/NNP proposal/NN for/IN a/DT televised/VBN debate/NN comes/VBZ just/RB four/CD months/NNS after/IN millions/NNS of/IN viewers/NNS were/VBD able/JJ to/TO watch/VB US/PRP President/NNP George/NNP W/NNP Bush/NNP slug/NN it/PRP out/RP verbally/RB with/IN his/PRP$ Democratic/JJ challenger/NN John/NNP Kerry./NNP
He/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT "democratically/RB dubious/JJ proposition"/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD up/IN to/TO the/DT incumbent/JJ prime/JJ minister/NN to/TO decide/VB whether/IN a/DT similar/JJ event/NN takes/VBZ place/NN here./NN

If/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP did/VBD not/RB want/VB to/TO take/VB part/NN the/DT broadcasters/NNS could/MD go/VB ahead/RB with/IN an/DT empty/JJ chair/NN or/CC cancel/VB the/DT event/NN and/CC explain/VB their/PRP$ reasons/NNS why/WRB Lord/NNP Holme/NNP said./NN
"What/NN makes/VBZ the/DT present/JJ situation/NN even/RB less/RBR acceptable/JJ is/VBZ that/IN although/IN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP and/CC Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP have/VBP said/VBN they/PRP would/MD welcome/VB a/DT debate/NN no-one/JJ has/VBZ heard/VBN directly/RB from/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"It/NN has/VBZ been/VBN left/VBN to/TO nudges/NNS and/CC winks/NNS hints/NNS and/CC briefings/NNS from/IN his/PRP$ aides/NNS and/CC campaign/NN managers/NNS to/TO imply/VB that/IN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP doesn't/NN want/VBP one/CD but/CC we/PRP haven't/VBP heard/VBN from/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN himself."/NN

Lord/NNP Holme/NNP who/WP has/VBZ campaigned/VBN for/IN televised/VBN debates/NNS at/IN previous/JJ elections/NNS said/VBD broadcasters/NNS were/VBD "more/NN than/IN willing/JJ to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN the/DT arrangements"./NN
Opinion/NN polls/NNS suggested/VBD that/IN the/DT idea/NN had/VBD the/DT backing/NN of/IN the/DT public/JJ who/WP like/IN comparing/VBG the/DT personalities/NNS and/CC policies/NNS of/IN the/DT contenders/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ homes/NNS he/PRP said./VB

Lord/NNP Holme/NNP argued/VBD that/IN as/IN part/NN of/IN their/PRP$ public/JJ service/NN obligations/NNS broadcasters/NNS "should/NN make/VBP the/DT decision/NN to/TO go/VB ahead"/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT election/NN is/VBZ called./NN
An/DT independent/JJ third-party/JJ body/NN such/JJ as/IN the/DT Hansard/NNP Society/NNP or/CC Electoral/JJ Commission/NNP could/MD work/VB out/RP the/DT ground/NN rules/NNS so/IN they/PRP were/VBD fair/JJ to/TO participants/NNS and/CC informative/JJ to/TO the/DT public/JJ he/PRP said./VB
"It/NN would/MD be/VB up/IN to/TO each/DT party/NN leader/NN to/TO accept/VB or/CC refuse"/NN said/VBD Lord/NNP Holme./NNP

"If/NN the/DT prime/JJ minister's/NNS reported/VBD position/NN is/VBZ true/JJ and/CC he/PRP does/VBZ want/VB to/TO take/VB part/NN he/PRP would/MD then/RB be/VB obliged/VBN to/TO say/VB why/WRB publicly./NN
"The/NN broadcasters/NNS would/MD then/RB have/VB the/DT option/NN of/IN cancelling/VBG the/DT event/NN for/IN obvious/JJ and/CC well-understood/JJ reasons/NNS or/CC going/VBG ahead/RB with/IN an/DT empty/JJ chair./NN
"Either/NN way/NN would/MD be/VB preferable/JJ to/TO the/DT present/JJ hidden/JJ veto."/NN The/DT Hansard/NNP Society/NNP has/VBZ long/RB campaigned/VBN for/IN televised/VBN debates/NNS and/CC has/VBZ published/VBN reports/NNS on/IN the/DT issue/NN in/IN 1997/CD and/CC 2001./CD
Tony/NNP Blair/NNP has/VBZ already/RB ruled/VBN out/RP taking/VBG part/NN in/IN a/DT televised/VBN debate/NN during/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ election/NN campaign./NN
