A/DT year/NN to/TO remember/VB for/IN Irish/JJ

There/EX used/VBN to/TO be/VB one/CD subliminal/JJ moment/NN during/IN a/DT year/NN in/IN Irish/JJ rugby/NN that/WDT stood/VBD out/RP more/JJR than/IN most./NN

Well/RB at/IN least/JJS there/EX used/VBN to/TO one./VB
Now/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT handful/NN to/TO look/VB back/RB with/IN a/DT mixture/NN of/IN satisfaction/NN and/CC sorrow./NN
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN quite/RB a/DT year/NN for/IN the/DT Irish/JJ and/CC not/RB just/RB with/IN Eddie/NNP O'Sullivan's/NNP Triple/JJ Crown/NNP winning/VBG international/JJ outfit/NN either./NN
Right/RB down/RB through/IN the/DT ranks/NNS Irish/JJ rugby/NN is/VBZ creating/VBG waves/NNS and/CC upsetting/VBG the/DT more/RBR established/JJ teams/NNS in/IN the/DT game./NN
But/CC most/JJS of/IN the/DT kudos/NNS will/MD go/VB to/TO O'Sullivan/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ merry/NN band/NN of/IN warriors/NNS who/WP not/RB only/RB collected/VBN their/PRP$ first/JJ Triple/JJ Crown/NNP for/IN 29/CD years/NNS but/CC also/RB finished/VBD their/PRP$ autumn/NN campaign/NN with/IN a/DT 100%/CD record./NN
For/IN the/DT second/JJ year/NN in/IN succession/NN they/PRP also/RB finished/VBD in/IN the/DT runners-up/NNS spot/NN in/IN the/DT RBS/NNP Six/CD Nations./NNP
But/CC in/IN the/DT three/CD games/NNS in/IN November/NNP which/WDT included/VBD a/DT victory/NN over/IN Tri-Nations/NNP champions/NNS and/CC Grand/NNP Slam/NNP chasing/VBG South/NNP Africa/NNP Ireland/NNP finsihed/VBD the/DT year/NN on/IN a/DT high./NN
The/DT 18-12/JJ victory/NN at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP was/VBD only/RB their/PRP$ second/JJ victory/NN over/IN the/DT Boks/NNP after/IN the/DT initial/JJ success/NN back/RB in/IN 1965./CD
That/DT success/NN was/VBD revenge/NN for/IN the/DT consecutive/JJ defeats/NNS in/IN Blomefontein/NNP and/CC Cape/NNP Town/NNP in/IN the/DT summer./NN
Those/DT two/CD reverses/VBZ and/CC the/DT 35-17/JJ flop/NN against/IN France/NNP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ dark/JJ patches/NNS in/IN an/DT otherwise/RB excellent/JJ 12/CD months./NN
But/CC the/DT big/JJ one/CD of/IN course/NN was/VBD the/DT 19-13/JJ defeat/NN of/IN World/NNP Cup/NNP champions/NNS England/NNP on/IN their/PRP$ precious/JJ Twickenham/NNP turf./NN
The/DT winning/VBG try/NN was/VBD conceived/VBN in/IN O'Sullivan's/NNP mind/NN perfectly/RB executed/VBN by/IN the/DT team/NN and/CC finished/VBD immaculately/RB by/IN Girvan/NNP Dempsey./NNP
For/IN me/PRP the/DT try/NN of/IN the/DT Championship./NNP
O'Sullivan's/NNP career/NN is/VBZ now/RB in/IN vertical/JJ take-off/JJ mode./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ no/DT wonder/NN that/IN Sir/NNP Clive/NNP Woodward/NNP has/VBZ elevated/JJ the/DT Galway-based/JJ coach/NN to/TO head/VB the/DT Lions/NNP Test/NNP side./NN
Not/RB only/RB that/IN but/CC a/DT fair/JJ majority/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ Ireland/NNP side/NN will/MD be/VB wearing/VBG red/JJ next/JJ June/NNP in/IN New/NNP Zealand./NNP

There/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT doubt/NN that/IN Ireland's/NNP representation/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT biggest/JJS ever/RB albeit/IN in/IN a/DT proposed/VBN 44-man/JJ squad./NN
In/IN Brian/NNP O'Driscoll/NNP and/CC Paul/NNP O'Connell/NNP Ireland/NNP have/VBP now/RB the/DT two/CD front-runners/NNS for/IN the/DT captaincy./NN
Gordon/NNP D'Arcy/NNP whose/WP$ career/NN began/VBD as/IN a/DT teenager/NN back/RB in/IN 1999/CD finally/RB arrived/VBD when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD named/VBN the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS Player/NNP of/IN the/DT Tournament./NNP
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB only/RB the/DT senior/JJ squad/NN that/WDT brought/VBD kudos/NNS to/TO Ireland/NNP the/DT youngsters/NNS strutted/VBD their/PRP$ stuff/NN on/IN the/DT big/JJ stage/NN as/IN well./NN
The/DT under-21/JJ squad/NN confounded/VBD the/DT doubters/NNS as/IN they/PRP went/VBD all/PDT the/DT way/NN to/TO the/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP final/JJ in/IN Scotland/NNP only/RB to/TO be/VB beaten/VBN by/IN a/DT powerful/JJ All/DT Black/NNP side/NN in/IN the/DT decider./NN
The/DT young/JJ Irish/JJ boys/NNS had/VBD stated/VBN their/PRP$ intentions/NNS earlier/RBR in/IN the/DT season/NN when/WRB they/PRP finished/VBD runners-up/NNS to/TO England/NNP in/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS under-21/JJ tournament./NN
On/IN the/DT provincial/JJ front/NN Leinster/NNP for/IN second/JJ year/NN in/IN succession/NN blew/VBD it/PRP when/WRB the/DT Heineken/NNP Cup/NNP looked/VBD a/DT good/JJ wager./NN
While/IN Ulster/NNP finished/VBD runners-up/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ very/RB tight/JJ group/NN for/IN the/DT second/JJ season/NN in/IN succession/NN it/PRP was/VBD Munster/NNP again/RB flying/VBG the/DT flag/NN for/IN the/DT Irish./NNP
Looking/VBG to/TO reach/VB their/PRP$ third/JJ final/NN they/PRP went/VBD down/RB 37-32/JJ to/TO eventual/JJ winners/NNS Wasps/NNP in/IN what/WP many/JJ beileve/NN was/VBD the/DT most/RBS competitive/JJ and/CC thunderous/JJ game/NN ever/RB witnessed/VBN at/IN Lansdowne/NNP Road./NNP
How/WRB Wasps/NNP recovered/VBD from/IN that/DT energy-sapping/JJ duel/NN and/CC then/RB go/VB onto/IN to/TO defeat/VB Toulouse/NNP in/IN the/DT final/NN was/VBD anybody's/NNS guess./NN
Ulster/NNP meanwhile/RB just/RB lost/VBD out/RP to/TO adding/VBG the/DT inaugural/JJ Celtic/NNP Cup/NNP in/IN winning/VBG the/DT Celtic/NNP League/NNP when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD pipped/VBN at/IN the/DT post/NN by/IN the/DT Scarlets/NNPS in/IN the/DT final/JJ game./NN

Ulster/NNP however/RB took/VBD time/NN to/TO start/VB the/DT new/JJ season/NN under/IN new/JJ coach/NN Mark/NNP McCall./NNP
The/DT once/RB famous/JJ Ravenhill/NNP fortress/JJ was/VBD breached/VBN four/CD times/NNS as/IN Ulster/NNP only/RB manged/VBD five/CD wins/VBZ from/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ 12/CD outings/NNS in/IN the/DT Celtic/NNP League./NNP
Leinster/NNS are/VBP again/RB looking/VBG the/DT most/RBS potent/JJ outfit/NN going/VBG into/IN 2005/CD but/CC whether/IN they/PRP can/MD take/VB that/IN final/JJ step/NN under/IN Declan/NNP Kidney/NN is/VBZ another/DT thing./NN
On/IN the/DT down/JJ side/NN Irish/JJ rugby/NN was/VBD hit/VBN by/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN tragedies./NN
Teenage/JJ star/NN John/NNP McCall/NNP died/VBD while/IN playing/VBG for/IN the/DT Ireland/NNP against/IN New/NNP Zealand/NNP in/IN the/DT under-19/JJ World/NNP Cup/NNP game/NN in/IN Durban./NNP
That/DT happened/VBD only/RB 10/CD days/NNS after/IN he/PRP led/VBD Royal/NNP Armagh/NNP to/TO their/PRP$ first/JJ Ulster/NNP Schools'/NNP Cup/NNP success/NN since/IN 1977./CD
The/DT death/NN of/IN former/JJ Ireland/NNP coach/NN and/CC Lions/NNP flanker/NN Mike/NNP Doyle/NNP in/IN a/DT car/NN crash/NN in/IN Northern/JJ Ireland/NNP shocked/VBD the/DT rugby/NN fraternity/NN A/DT larger/JJR than/IN life/NN character/NN Doyle/NNP had/VBD coached/VBN Ireland/NNP to/TO the/DT Triple/JJ Crown/NNP in/IN 1985/CD the/DT last/JJ time/NN that/DT goal/NN had/VBD been/VBN achieved/VBN before/IN this/DT season./NN
Ulster/NNP rugby/NN also/RB suffered/VBD the/DT sudden/JJ deaths/NNS of/IN well-known/JJ Londonderry/NNP YM/NNP player/NN Jim/NNP Huey/NNP Coleraine's/NNP Jonathan/NNP Hutchinson/NNP and/CC Belfast/NNP Harlequins/NNP lock/VB Johnny/NNP Poole./NNP
They/PRP all/DT passed/VBN away/RB long/RB before/IN the/DT full-time/JJ whistle./NN
