"But/NNP I'm/NNP delighted/JJ with/IN the/DT match/NN result./NN
They/PRP say/VBP in/IN sport/NN you/PRP can/MD win/VB ugly/JJ -/: and/CC we/PRP certainly/RB did."/VBP McClaren/NNP was/VBD relieved/VBN to/TO make/VB it/PRP through/RP after/IN a/DT tough/JJ encounter/NN at/IN The/DT Riverside./NNP

"To/NN be/VB fair/JJ to/TO Graz/NNP they/PRP had/VBD a/DT gameplan/NN -/: they/PRP knocked/VBD the/DT ball/NN forward/RB especially/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ half/NN and/CC we/PRP struggled/VBD to/TO deal/VB with/IN it./NN
"In/NN the/DT second/JJ half/NN we/PRP were/VBD better/RBR but/CC it/PRP was/VBD frustrating/JJ because/IN we/PRP got/VBD the/DT goal/NN -/: but/CC one/CD slip/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD back/RB in/IN it."/NN Boro/NNP face/NN Sporting/NNP Lisbon/NNP for/IN a/DT place/NN in/IN the/DT quarter-finals/NNS after/IN the/DT Portuguese/NNP side/NN saw/VBD off/RP Feyenoord/NNP on/IN Thursday./NNP

"We/NN didn't/NN play/NN well/RB at/IN all./NN
But/CC you/PRP need/VBP a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN luck/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP got/VBD that/IN when/WRB my/PRP$ shot/NN went/VBD through/RB the/DT legs/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ goalkeeper./NN
"I/NN would/MD have/VB liked/VBN to/TO play/VB in/IN Holland/NNP -/: that/WDT would/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN special/JJ to/TO me./VB
"But/NN so/RB is/VBZ going/VBG back/RB to/TO Portugal/NNP -/: I'll/NNP be/VB playing/VBG against/IN some/DT lads/NNS I/PRP played/VBD with/IN at/IN Boavista."/NNP
