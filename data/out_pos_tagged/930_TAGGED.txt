Tories/NNS attack/NN burglar/NN 'U-turns'/JJ

Tory/NNP leader/NN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP has/VBZ accused/VBN Tony/NNP Blair/NNP of/IN performing/VBG U-turns/NNP over/IN rules/NNS on/IN using/VBG force/NN against/IN burglars./NN

The/DT government/NN has/VBZ ruled/VBN out/RP amending/VBG the/DT present/JJ law/NN which/WDT allows/VBZ "reasonable/JJ force"/NN in/IN self/NN defence./NN
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP branded/VBD the/DT decision/NN unacceptable/JJ saying/JJ "It/NN is/VBZ not/RB householders/NNS who/WP should/MD be/VB frightened/JJ it's/NNS the/DT burglars."/NN Home/NNP Secretary/NNP Charles/NNP Clarke/NNP said/VBD ministers/NNS had/VBD kept/VBN to/TO their/PRP$ pledge/NN to/TO review/VB the/DT law./NN

Metropolitan/NNP Police/NNP Commissioner/NNP Sir/NNP John/NNP Stevens/NNP last/JJ month/NN backed/VBD a/DT Tory/NNP attempt/NN to/TO change/VB the/DT law/NN so/RB only/JJ householders/NNS using/VBG "grossly/RB disproportionate"/JJ force/NN could/MD be/VB prosecuted./NN
The/DT pressure/NN prompted/VBD the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN to/TO say/VB the/DT police/NN and/CC Crown/NNP Prosecution/NNP Service/NNP would/MD be/VB consulted/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT review/NN of/IN the/DT law./NN
He/PRP told/VBD MPs/NNP "If/NN we/PRP get/VBP the/DT right/JJ response/NN from/IN those/DT people/NNS we/PRP will/MD of/IN course/NN support/NN a/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT law."/NN Instead/RB the/DT government/NN has/VBZ decided/VBN no/DT change/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN but/CC there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT publicity/NN campaign/NN so/RB people/VBZ are/VBP clear/JJ they/PRP are/VBP entitled/VBN to/TO defend/VB themselves./NN
On/IN Thursday/NNP Mr/NNP Howard/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP 4's/CD Today/NN programme/NN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP had/VBD initially/RB refused/VBN the/DT law/NN change/NN then/RB had/VBD come/VBN round/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN and/CC was/VBD now/RB backtracking/VBG again./NN
He/PRP said/VBD "We've/NN had/VBD three/CD policy/NN positions/NNS in/IN three/CD months/NNS and/CC two/CD U-turns./NNP
"It's/NN not/RB surprising/JJ Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP told/VBD him/PRP 'There's/VB nothing/NN you/PRP could/MD say/VB to/TO me/PRP now/RB that/IN I/PRP could/MD ever/RB believe.'"/VB

Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD the/DT "grossly/RB disproportionate"/JJ test/NN matched/VBD the/DT hurdle/NN ministers/NNS had/VBD introduced/VBN for/IN civil/JJ cases/NNS where/WRB burglars/NNS where/WRB claimed/VBD compensation/NN from/IN householders./NN
The/DT issue/NN entered/VBD the/DT public/JJ spotlight/NN when/WRB Norfolk/NNP farmer/NN Tony/NNP Martin/NNP was/VBD jailed/VBN for/IN shooting/VBG dead/JJ a/DT 16-year-old/JJ burglar/NN in/IN 1999/CD as/IN he/PRP ran/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT farm./NN
But/CC the/DT home/NN secretary/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Howard/NNP was/VBD wrong/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT law/NN was/VBD biased/VBN in/IN favour/NN of/IN burglars./NN
The/DT barrister/NN who/WP had/VBD represented/VBN Mr/NNP Martin/NNP had/VBD said/VBN the/DT rules/NNS were/VBD "weighted/VBN overwhelmingly"/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT householder/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Clarke./NNP
He/PRP said/VBD "The/NN problem/NN is/VBZ there/EX has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN enough/JJ understanding/NN of/IN it/PRP -/: that/DT was/VBD the/DT point/NN Sir/NNP John/NNP Stevens/NNP was/VBD making/VBG and/CC the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN was/VBD making."/NN The/DT new/JJ guidance/NN would/MD help/VB ensure/VB clarity/NN on/IN the/DT issue/NN added/VBD Mr/NNP Clarke./NNP
The/DT director/NN of/IN public/JJ prosecutions/NNS Ken/NNP Macdonald/NNP says/VBZ only/RB 11/CD householders/NNS or/CC occupiers/NNS of/IN business/NN premises/NNS have/VBP been/VBN prosecuted/VBN in/IN the/DT last/JJ 15/CD years./NN
Those/DT cases/NNS included/VBD a/DT warehouse/NN manager/NN who/WP had/VBD waited/VBN for/IN a/DT burglar/NN tied/VBD him/PRP up/RP beat/VB him/PRP and/CC set/VBD him/PRP alight/VB he/PRP said./VB
Tory/NNP MP/NNP Patrick/NNP Mercer's/NNP private/JJ member's/NNS bill/NN to/TO change/VB the/DT law/NN received/VBD a/DT first/JJ reading/NN in/IN Parliament/NNP on/IN Wednesday/NNP and/CC goes/VBZ to/TO a/DT full/JJ debate/NN next/JJ month./NN
