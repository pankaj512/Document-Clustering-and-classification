"There's/NN no/DT doubt/NN about/IN it/PRP I/PRP am/VBP out/IN of/IN here."/NN The/DT difficult/JJ relationship/NN between/IN Souness/NN and/CC Bellamy/NNP boiled/VBD over/RP at/IN the/DT weekend/NN and/CC has/VBZ led/VBN to/TO a/DT war/NN of/IN words/NNS in/IN the/DT media./NN

Bellamy's/NNP claim/NN that/DT Souness/NN had/VBD lied/VBN about/IN the/DT background/NN to/TO the/DT bust-up/NN was/VBD strongly/RB denied/VBN by/IN Shepherd/NNP who/WP accused/VBD the/DT striker/NN of/IN "cheating"/NN the/DT club./NN
"I/NN wish/VBP to/TO put/VB the/DT record/NN straight/RB regarding/NN the/DT Bellamy/NNP situation"/NN said/VBD Shepherd./NNP
"Craig/NN walked/VBD off/RP the/DT training/NN ground/NN saying/VBG his/PRP$ hamstring/VBG was/VBD tight/JJ (on/NN Friday)/NNP but/CC what/WP he/PRP failed/VBD to/TO reveal/VB was/VBD that/IN he/PRP had/VBD told/VBN other/JJ members/NNS of/IN the/DT squad/NN before/IN training/NN that/IN he/PRP intended/VBD to/TO feign/VB injury./NN

"He/NN is/VBZ paid/VBN extremely/RB well/RB and/CC I/PRP consider/VBP his/PRP$ behaviour/NN to/TO be/VB totally/RB unacceptable/JJ and/CC totally/RB unprofessional."/NN

Bellamy's/NNP latest/JJS outburst/NN would/MD appear/VB to/TO make/VB his/PRP$ chances/NNS of/IN a/DT first-team/JJ recall/NN remote./NN

"It's/NN a/DT very/RB difficult/JJ situation/NN for/IN me/PRP at/IN the/DT moment/NN but/CC I'd/NNP never/RB ask/VBD to/TO leave/VB this/DT club./NN
"This/NN club/NN means/VBZ so/RB much/RB to/TO me./VB
I/PRP couldn't/VBP do/VBP it/PRP because/IN I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP couldn't/VBP come/VBN back/RB here/RB and/CC play/VB against/IN Newcastle./NNP
It/PRP would/MD hurt/VB too/RB much."/NN
