Public/NN accounts/NNS committee/NN chairman/NN Edward/NNP Leigh/NNP was/VBD giving/VBG his/PRP$ reaction/NN to/TO a/DT report/NN by/IN a/DT government/NN watchdog/NN on/IN lessons/NNS to/TO be/VB learnt/NN from/IN the/DT crisis./NN
The/DT National/NNP Audit/NNP Office/NNP said/VBD Defra/NNP had/VBD improved/VBN its/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN future/JJ livestock/NN disease/NN outbreaks./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Leigh/NNP said/VBD the/DT department/NN was/VBD "dragging/VBG its/PRP$ heels"./NN

That/DT comment/NN referred/VBD to/TO the/DT setting/VBG up/RP of/IN a/DT scheme/NN to/TO share/VB any/DT future/JJ compensation/NN costs/NNS with/IN industry./NN
He/PRP also/RB said/VBD Defra/NNP had/VBD been/VBN "dreadfully/RB slow"/NN in/IN paying/VBG some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ bills/NNS dating/VBG from/IN the/DT foot/NN and/CC mouth/NN crisis./NN

The/DT outbreak/NN which/WDT began/VBD in/IN 2001/CD led/VBN to/TO the/DT slaughter/NN of/IN 6.5/CD million/CD animals/NNS devastated/VBD many/JJ farms/NNS and/CC rural/JJ businesses/NNS and/CC is/VBZ estimated/VBN to/TO have/VB cost/VBN the/DT UK/NNP up/IN to/TO £8bn./CD
"Four/NN years/NNS after/IN the/DT outbreak/NN Defra/NNP is/VBZ yet/RB to/TO begin/VB its/PRP$ planned/VBN review/NN of/IN some/DT of/IN its/PRP$ contractors'/NN costs/NNS and/CC £40m/CD of/IN invoices/NNS remain/VBP unpaid"/NN Mr/NNP Leigh/NNP said./NN
Mr/NNP Leigh/NNP also/RB pointed/VBD out/RP that/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN an/DT IT/PRP system/VBP to/TO help/VB control/VB future/JJ outbreaks/NNS had/VBD been/VBN delayed./NN
In/IN November/NNP it/PRP emerged/VBD European/NNP Commission/NNP compensation/NN amounted/VBD to/TO just/RB over/IN a/DT third/JJ of/IN the/DT money/NN the/DT UK/NNP government/NN had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO get/VB as/IN reimbursement/NN for/IN the/DT billions/NNS lost/VBN through/IN the/DT foot/NN and/CC mouth/NN crisis./NN

Ministers/NNS had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO get/VB £900m/CD from/IN the/DT European/NNP Union/NNP Vet/NN Fund/NNP to/TO help/VB with/IN animal/NN slaughter/NN and/CC other/JJ costs/NNS but/CC in/IN the/DT end/NN was/VBD granted/VBN £349m./CD
That/DT was/VBD because/IN the/DT UK/NNP had/VBD valued/VBN the/DT culled/VBN animals/NNS at/IN between/IN "two/NN and/CC three/CD times"/NN the/DT commission's/NNS assessment/NN of/IN their/PRP$ likely/JJ market/NN value./NN

On/IN the/DT issue/NN of/IN the/DT unpaid/JJ invoices/NNS Sir/NNP John/NNP said/VBD Defra/NNP had/VBD paid/VBN 97%/CD of/IN the/DT £1.3bn/CD submitted/VBN by/IN contractors/NNS since/IN 2001/CD "but/NN has/VBZ not/RB agreed/VBN a/DT final/JJ settlement/NN with/IN 57/CD contractors/NNS pending/VBG the/DT results/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ investigations"./NN

Mr/NNP Leigh/NNP said/VBD being/VBG "better/NN prepared"/NN would/MD also/RB help/VB avoid/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN "mass/NN funeral/JJ pyres/NNS which/WDT provided/VBD an/DT unsettling/JJ images/NNS of/IN the/DT 2001/CD outbreak"./NN
A/DT Defra/NNP spokesman/NN said/VBD "We/NN welcome/VBP the/DT report./NN
It/PRP acknowledges/VBZ the/DT progress/NN the/DT department/NN has/VBZ made/VBN since/IN 2001/CD -/: particularly/RB on/IN contingency/NN planning/NN and/CC our/PRP$ improved/VBN capacity/NN and/CC preparedness/NN for/IN combating/VBG another/DT major/JJ disease/NN outbreak./NN
