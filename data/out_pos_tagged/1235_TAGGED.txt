Lib/NNP Dems/NNP target/NN first-time/JJ buyers/NNS

The/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS have/VBP unveiled/VBN plans/NNS to/TO build/VB 100000/CD new/JJ "affordable"/NN homes/NNS on/IN publicly/RB owned/VBN land./NN

The/DT party's/NNS scheme/NN would/MD allow/VB people/NNS to/TO buy/VB a/DT share/NN in/IN a/DT home/NN through/IN a/DT mutual/JJ home/NN ownership/NN trust/NN as/IN a/DT way/NN of/IN getting/VBG onto/IN the/DT housing/NN ladder./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP would/MD also/RB encourage/VB the/DT conversion/NN of/IN existing/VBG buildings/NNS in/IN an/DT effort/NN to/TO protect/VB greenfield/NN sites./NN
Labour/NNP has/VBZ already/RB announced/VBN plans/NNS to/TO help/VB first-time/JJ buyers/NNS and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS would/MD extend/VB right-to-buy/JJ schemes./NN

All/PDT the/DT major/JJ parties/NNS are/VBP focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT issue/NN in/IN the/DT run-up/NN to/TO the/DT election/NN after/IN a/DT survey/NN suggested/VBD first-time/JJ buyers/NNS could/MD not/RB afford/VB a/DT home/NN in/IN 92%/CD of/IN UK/NNP towns./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP say/VBP their/PRP$ "mutual/JJ homes"/NN would/MD let/VB people/NNS buy/VB a/DT share/NN of/IN a/DT property/NN usually/RB worth/JJ about/RB 5%/CD of/IN the/DT building/NN costs./NN
Party/NNP leader/NN Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP said/VBD the/DT homes/NNS would/MD be/VB affordable/JJ because/IN they/PRP would/MD be/VB built/VBN on/IN surplus/NN public/JJ sector/NN land/NN donated/VBN by/IN central/JJ or/CC local/JJ government./NN
People/NNS would/MD also/RB only/RB have/VBP to/TO pay/VB for/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN and/CC not/RB the/DT land/NN he/PRP added./VB

They/PRP would/MD spend/VB about/IN 30%/CD of/IN their/PRP$ monthly/JJ salary/NN on/IN rent/NN and/CC buying/VBG extra/JJ shares/NNS in/IN the/DT property./NN
When/WRB they/PRP moved/VBD house/NN they/PRP would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO cash/VB in/RP on/IN any/DT rise/NN in/IN property/NN prices/NNS by/IN selling/VBG their/PRP$ share./NN
It/PRP would/MD also/RB allow/VB councils/NNS to/TO vary/VB discounts/NNS to/TO tenants/NNS given/VBD the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB their/PRP$ council/NN homes/NNS so/RB local/JJ needs/VBZ were/VBD taken/VBN into/IN account./NN
Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP said/VBD "Mutual/JJ homes/NNS will/MD offer/VB people/NNS the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO build/VB up/RP an/DT equity/NN stake/NN in/IN a/DT home/NN gradually/RB investing/VBG only/RB as/RB much/RB as/IN they/PRP can/MD afford."/VB

There/EX are/VBP also/RB plans/NNS to/TO prevent/VB high/JJ house/NN prices/NNS forcing/VBG people/NNS out/IN of/IN their/PRP$ local/JJ communities./NN
The/DT kind/NN of/IN "golden/NN share"/NN used/VBN by/IN the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP in/IN South/NNP Shropshire/NNP could/MD be/VB rolled/VBN out/RP more/RBR widely./NN
Under/IN the/DT plan/NN councils/NNS secure/VBP deals/NNS with/IN developers/NNS where/WRB they/PRP keep/VBP a/DT 1%/CD share/NN in/IN a/DT property/NN scheme/NN so/RB properties/VBZ cannot/NN be/VB sold/VBN on/IN the/DT open/JJ market./NN
Instead/RB they/PRP are/VBP sold/VBN at/IN "build/NN cost"/NN to/TO people/NNS who/WP the/DT local/JJ council/NN decides/VBZ have/VBP local/JJ needs./NN
The/DT party/NN says/VBZ its/PRP$ help/NN for/IN first-time/JJ buyers/NNS can/MD be/VB funded/VBN at/IN no/DT extra/JJ cost/NN to/TO the/DT taxpayer./NN
But/CC the/DT plans/NNS involve/VBP changing/VBG the/DT VAT/NNP system/NN which/WDT the/DT party/NN says/VBZ often/RB makes/VBZ it/PRP too/RB expensive/JJ to/TO renovate/VB existing/VBG buildings./NN

The/DT Conservatives/NNS claimed/VBD the/DT plans/NNS would/MD amount/VB to/TO an/DT extra/JJ tax/NN of/IN up/IN to/TO £11000/CD on/IN every/DT new/JJ house./NN
"This/NN is/VBZ typical/JJ of/IN Lib/NNP Dem/NNP hypocrisy"/NN said/VBD Tory/NNP shadow/NN local/JJ government/NN secretary/NN Caroline/NNP Spelman./NNP
"They/NN claim/NN that/IN they/PRP want/VBP to/TO help/VB people/NNS on/RP to/TO the/DT property/NN ladder/NN but/CC the/DT small/JJ print/NN of/IN their/PRP$ policies/NNS reveal/VBP how/WRB they/PRP intend/VBP to/TO price/VB even/RB more/RBR people/NNS out/IN of/IN the/DT housing/NN market."/NN The/DT flagship/NN Tory/NNP proposal/NN on/IN housing/NN policy/NN is/VBZ to/TO give/VB a/DT million/CD more/JJR housing/NN association/NN tenants/NNS the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB their/PRP$ homes./NN
Labour/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN it/PRP will/MD allow/VB 300000/CD council/NN and/CC housing/NN association/NN tenants/NNS to/TO buy/VB a/DT share/NN in/IN their/PRP$ homes./NN
Housing/NNP Minister/NNP Keith/NNP Hill/NNP said/VBD much/JJ of/IN the/DT Lib/NNP Dem/NNP plans/VBZ mimicked/VBD the/DT government's/NNS strategy./NN
"However/NN as/RB usual/JJ the/DT Lib/NNP Dems'/NNP proposals/NNS are/VBP completely/RB uncosted"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Mr/NNP Hill/NNP said/VBD he/PRP also/RB asked/VBD whether/IN the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP would/MD match/VB Labour's/NNP promise/NN to/TO spend/VB £42bn/CD on/IN making/VBG refurbishing/VBG and/CC repair/NN council/NN homes/NNS by/IN 2010./CD
