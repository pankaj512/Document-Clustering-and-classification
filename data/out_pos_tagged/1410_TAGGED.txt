However/RB I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP still/RB believe/VB the/DT Chelsea/NNP player/NN in/IN question/NN did/VBD go/VB down/RP too/RB easily."/NN Speaking/VBG immediately/RB after/IN the/DT game/NN Moyes/NNP said/VBD "I/NN don't/NN think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT sending-off/JJ I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT centre-half/NN in/IN my/PRP$ time/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN ashamed/JJ to/TO have/VB gone/VBN down/RP as/RB easily/RB as/IN that./NN

I/PRP have/VBP never/RB heard/VBN of/IN anybody/NN butting/VBG somebody/NN from/IN behind/RB while/IN you/PRP are/VBP running/VBG after/IN them./NN
"What/NN has/VBZ happened/VBN to/TO big/JJ strong/JJ centre-halves?/NN I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT push/NN initially/RB and/CC I/PRP still/RB don't/VBP think/VBP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT sending-off."/JJ An/DT angry/JJ Beattie/NNP initially/RB said/VBD "He/NN (Gallas)/NN would/MD have/VB stayed/VBN down/RP a/DT lot/NN longer/RBR if/IN I/PRP had/VBD headbutted/VBN him./NN
"I/NN can/MD tell/VB you/PRP it/PRP wasn't/NN an/DT intentional/JJ headbutt./NN
We/PRP were/VBD chasing/VBG a/DT ball/NN into/IN the/DT corner/NN and/CC William/NNP Gallas/NNP was/VBD looking/VBG over/IN his/PRP$ shoulder/NN and/CC blocking/VBG me/PRP off./VBP
"He/NN was/VBD stopping/VBG as/IN we/PRP were/VBD running/VBG and/CC I/PRP said/VBD to/TO myself/PRP 'if/VBP you're/NN going/VBG to/TO stay/VB in/IN my/PRP$ way/NN I'll/NNP go/VBP straight/JJ over/IN you'./NN
