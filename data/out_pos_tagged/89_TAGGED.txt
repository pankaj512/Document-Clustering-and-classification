European/JJ leaders/NNS have/VBP openly/RB blamed/VBN the/DT US/PRP for/IN the/DT sharp/JJ rise/NN in/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT euro./NN

US/PRP officials/VBZ were/VBD talking/VBG up/RP the/DT dollar/NN they/PRP said/VBD but/CC failing/VBG to/TO take/VB action/NN to/TO back/VB up/RP their/PRP$ words./NN
Meeting/VBG in/IN Brussels/NNP finance/NN ministers/NNS of/IN the/DT 12/CD eurozone/NN countries/NNS voiced/VBD their/PRP$ concern/NN that/IN the/DT rise/NN of/IN the/DT european/NN currency/NN was/VBD harming/VBG exports./NN
The/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ within/IN touching/VBG distance/NN of/IN an/DT all-time/JJ low/JJ reached/VBN earlier/RBR in/IN November./NNP
At/IN 0619/CD GMT/NNP on/IN Tuesday/NNP the/DT dollar/NN was/VBD up/RB slightly/RB at/IN just/RB above/IN $1.29/CD to/TO the/DT euro/NN and/CC buying/VBG 105.6/CD yen/NNS in/IN Tokyo./NNP
It/PRP rallied/VBD briefly/NN on/IN Monday/NNP amid/IN signs/NNS that/IN oil/NN prices/NNS are/VBP easing./NN

But/CC analysts/NNS said/VBD the/DT respite/NN was/VBD likely/JJ to/TO be/VB only/RB temporary./NN
The/DT European/JJ ministers'/NN comments/NNS said/VBD Junya/NNP Tanase/NNP of/IN JPMorgan/NNP Chase/NNP bank/NN in/IN Tokyo/NNP were/VBD "generally/RB too/RB weak/JJ to/TO produce/VB a/DT market/NN reaction"./NN

Still/RB by/IN the/DT standards/NNS of/IN diplomacy/NN the/DT European/JJ ministers/NNS were/VBD forthright./NN
Nicolas/NNP Sarkozy/NNP of/IN France/NNP said/VBD he/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ colleagues/NNS were/VBD unanimous/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ worry/NN that/IN the/DT decline/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN would/MD hit/VB Europe's/NNP economies/NNS by/IN eating/VBG into/IN their/PRP$ exports./NN
"We/NN are/VBP concerned/VBN about/IN these/DT developments/NNS which/WDT are/VBP destabilising/VBG and/CC which/WDT are/VBP linked/VBN to/TO the/DT accumulation/NN of/IN deficits/NNS by/IN our/PRP$ American/JJ friends"/NN he/PRP said./VB
The/DT comments/NNS come/VBP a/DT day/NN after/IN US/PRP Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP John/NNP Snow/NNP said/VBD a/DT strong/JJ dollar/NN was/VBD "in/NN America's/NNP interest"./JJ

But/CC that/DT was/VBD not/RB enough/RB for/IN Mr/NNP Sarkozy./NNP

"If/NN the/DT Americans/NNPS were/VBD to/TO change/VB their/PRP$ policy/NN it's/NNS up/IN to/TO them/PRP to/TO say/VB so"/NN he/PRP said./VB
And/CC the/DT European/NNP Union's/NNP monetary/JJ affairs/NNS commissioner/NN made/VBD it/PRP clear/JJ that/DT action/NN was/VBD necessary./NN
"I/NN fully/RB welcome/VB the/DT words/NNS of/IN Mr/NNP Snow"/NNP said/VBD Joaquin/NNP Almunia/NNP "but/NN we/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO see/VB decisions/NNS adopted/VBN in/IN that/DT direction./NN
"If/NN the/DT imbalances/NNS in/IN the/DT US/PRP economy/VBP are/VBP not/RB adjusted/VBN in/IN the/DT future/JJ the/DT decision/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN will/MD be/VB as/RB in/IN the/DT past/JJ weeks."/NN Economists/NNS point/VBP out/RP that/IN whatever/WDT Europe/NNP says/VBZ in/IN the/DT short/JJ term/NN a/DT weaker/JJR dollar/NN is/VBZ a/DT boon/NN to/TO President/NNP George/NNP W/NNP Bush's/NNP administration./NN
Not/RB only/RB does/VBZ it/PRP boost/VB US/PRP exports/NNS but/CC it/PRP also/RB makes/VBZ the/DT budget/NN deficit/NN easier/JJR to/TO fund./VB
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN slower/JJR European/JJ exports/NNS would/MD mean/VB slower/JJR EU/NNP growth/NN -/: potentially/RB reducing/VBG the/DT demand/NN for/IN US/PRP goods./VBP
