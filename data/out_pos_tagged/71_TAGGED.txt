Japanese/JJ brewers/NNS are/VBP increasingly/RB making/VBG money/NN from/IN beer-flavoured/JJ drinks/NNS rather/RB than/IN beer/NN itself/PRP

Beer/NNP and/CC spirits/NNS are/VBP heavily/RB taxed/VBN in/IN Japan/NNP driving/VBG breweries/NNS to/TO search/VB for/IN alternatives./NN
Japan's/NNP long/JJ economic/JJ downturn/NN helped/VBD drive/VB the/DT trend/NN as/IN drinkers/NNS looked/VBD for/IN cheaper/JJR opportunities/NNS to/TO drown/VB their/PRP$ sorrows./NN
