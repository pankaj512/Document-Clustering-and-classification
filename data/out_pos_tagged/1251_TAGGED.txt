Public/NNP trust/NN in/IN the/DT handling/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB restored/VBN if/IN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP opens/VBZ up/RP his/PRP$ books/NNS for/IN unbiased/JJ inspection/NN say/VBP the/DT Lib/NNP Dems./NNP

City/NN experts/NNS say/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT £10bn/CD "black/NN hole"/NN in/IN the/DT public/JJ finances/NNS a/DT claim/NN denied/VBN by/IN the/DT chancellor./NN
Lib/NNP Dem/NNP spokesman/NN Vince/NNP Cable/NNP said/VBD the/DT public/NN did/VBD not/RB know/VB who/WP to/TO believe/VB and/CC the/DT National/NNP Audit/NNP Office/NNP should/MD judge./VB
Responding/VBG to/TO the/DT pre-Budget/JJ report/NN Mr/NNP Cable/NNP also/RB attacked/VBD Labour's/NNP "unfair"/NN and/CC over-complicated/JJ taxes./NN

In/IN his/PRP$ report/NN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP insisted/VBD he/PRP was/VBD on/IN course/NN to/TO meet/VB his/PRP$ "golden/NN rule"/NN of/IN borrowing/NN only/RB to/TO invest/VB rather/RB than/IN for/IN day-to-day/JJ spending/NN over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ cycle./NN
Mr/NNP Cable/NNP said/VBD people/NNS did/VBD not/RB know/VB whether/IN to/TO believe/VB the/DT chancellor/NN or/CC the/DT consensus/NN among/IN experts/NNS which/WDT said/VBD the/DT rule/NN would/MD be/VB broken./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ an/DT issue/NN of/IN credibility/NN and/CC trust"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"We/NN cannot/NN have/VBP a/DT continuation/NN of/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB the/DT chancellor/NN sets/VBZ his/PRP$ own/JJ tests/NNS and/CC then/RB marks/NNS them./NN
"What/NN we/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ the/DT equivalent/NN of/IN a/DT thorough/JJ Ofsted/NNP inspection/NN of/IN the/DT government's/NNS accounts."/VBP He/PRP asked/VBD what/WP the/DT government/NN had/VBD to/TO hide./VB

Mr/NNP Cable/NNP also/RB accused/VBD the/DT chancellor/NN of/IN ducking/VBG tough/JJ choices./NN
He/PRP argued/VBD "There/NN are/VBP serious/JJ challenges/NNS ahead/RB from/IN the/DT falling/VBG dollar/NN and/CC from/IN the/DT rapid/JJ downturn/NN in/IN the/DT UK/NNP housing/NN market/NN and/CC rising/VBG personal/JJ debt./NN
But/CC they/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VBN confronted."/NN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP confirmed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD setting/VBG aside/RB another/DT £520m/CD for/IN the/DT conflicts/NNS in/IN Iraq/NNP and/CC Afghanistan./NNP
Mr/NNP Cable/NNP compared/VBD that/IN new/JJ cost/NN with/IN the/DT £500m/CD needed/VBN for/IN Britain's/NNP role/NN in/IN the/DT entire/JJ first/JJ Gulf/NNP War/NNP -/: when/WRB 80%/CD of/IN the/DT bill/NN had/VBD been/VBN met/VBN through/IN help/NN from/IN European/JJ and/CC Arab/NNP nations./NN
He/PRP suggested/VBD keeping/VBG British/JJ troops/NNS in/IN Iraq/NNP could/MD cost/VB another/DT £1bn/CD with/IN the/DT government/NN also/RB planning/VBG to/TO spend/VB at/IN least/JJS £3bn/CD for/IN identity/NN cards./NN
The/DT current/JJ economic/JJ climate/NN meant/VBN Britain/NNP could/MD not/RB afford/VB the/DT "reckless/NN George/NNP Bush-style/JJ tax/NN cutting/VBG spree"/NN planned/VBN by/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS he/PRP said./VB
Instead/RB what/WP was/VBD needed/VBN was/VBD simple/JJ and/CC fair/JJ taxation/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT "complete/NN mess"/NN produced/VBN by/IN Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP endless/JJ tinkering./NN

Mr/NNP Cable/NNP said/VBD 40%/CD of/IN all/DT pensioners/NNS were/VBD now/RB paying/VBG marginal/JJ tax/NN rates/NNS of/IN 50%./CD
And/CC one-and-a-half/JJ million/CD hard/JJ working/NN families/NNS were/VBD paying/VBG 60%/CD marginal/JJ tax/NN rates./NN
With/IN that/DT record/NN he/PRP asked/VBD why/WRB ministers/NNS attacked/VBD Lib/NNP Dem/NNP plans/VBZ for/IN a/DT new/JJ 50%/CD tax/NN rate/NN for/IN the/DT "very/NN rich"/NN -/: those/DT earning/VBG more/JJR than/IN £100000/CD a/DT year./NN
Mr/NNP Brown/NNP earmarked/VBD £1bn/CD to/TO help/VB keep/VB down/RP council/NN tax/NN rises/NNS next/IN year./NN
But/CC the/DT Lib/NNP Dem/NNP spokesman/NN questioned/VBD whether/IN that/DT money/NN was/VBD being/VBG found/VBD from/IN cuts/NNS to/TO education/VB and/CC health./NN
He/PRP urged/VBD the/DT government/NN to/TO scrap/VB the/DT "grossly/JJ unfair"/NN tax/NN completely./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP want/VBP it/PRP replaced/VBD with/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax./NN
In/IN response/NN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP stressed/VBD the/DT Iraq/NNP money/NN came/VBD from/IN a/DT reserve/NN funds./NN
It/PRP was/VBD because/IN he/PRP had/VBD rejected/VBN previous/JJ Lib/NNP Dem/NNP proposals/NNS such/JJ as/IN scrapping/VBG the/DT New/NNP Deal/NNP that/IN Britain's/NNP economy/NN was/VBD successful/NN claimed/VBD Mr/NNP Brown./NNP
