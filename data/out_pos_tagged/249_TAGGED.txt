Bush/NNP budget/NN seeks/VBZ deep/JJ cutbacks/NNS

President/NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ presented/VBN his/PRP$ 2006/CD budget/NN cutting/VBG domestic/JJ spending/NN in/IN a/DT bid/NN to/TO lower/JJR a/DT record/NN deficit/NN projected/VBN to/TO peak/VB at/IN $427bn/CD (£230bn)/CD this/DT year./NN

The/DT $2.58/CD trillion/CD (£1.38/CD trillion)/NN budget/NN submitted/VBN to/TO Congress/NNP affects/VBZ 150/CD domestic/JJ programmes/NNS from/IN farming/VBG to/TO the/DT environment/NN education/NN and/CC health./NN
But/CC foreign/JJ aid/NN is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO rise/NN by/IN 10%/CD with/IN more/JJR money/NN to/TO treat/VB HIV/Aids/NNP and/CC reward/JJ economic/JJ and/CC political/JJ reform./NN
Military/JJ spending/NN is/VBZ also/RB set/VBN to/TO rise/VB by/IN 4.8%/CD to/TO reach/VB $419.3bn./CD
The/DT budget/NN does/VBZ not/RB include/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN running/VBG military/JJ operations/NNS in/IN Iraq/NNP and/CC Afghanistan/NNP for/IN which/WDT the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO seek/VB an/DT extra/JJ $80bn/CD from/IN Congress/NNP later/RB this/DT year./NN

Congress/NNP will/MD spend/VB several/JJ months/NNS debating/VBG George/NNP W/NNP Bush's/NNP proposal./NN

The/DT state/NN department's/NNS planned/VBD budget/NN would/MD rise/VB to/TO just/RB under/IN $23bn/CD -/: a/DT fraction/NN of/IN the/DT defence/NN department's/NNS request/NN -/: including/VBG almost/RB $6bn/CD to/TO assist/VB US/PRP allies/NNS in/IN the/DT "war/NN on/IN terror"./NN
However/RB the/DT administration/NN is/VBZ keen/JJ to/TO highlight/VB its/PRP$ global/JJ effort/NN to/TO tackle/VB HIV/Aids/NNP the/DT BBC's/NNP Jonathan/NNP Beale/NNP reports/NNS and/CC planned/VBN spending/NN would/MD almost/RB double/VB to/TO $3bn/CD with/IN much/JJ of/IN that/DT money/NN going/VBG to/TO African/JJ nations./NN
Mr/NNP Bush/NNP also/RB wants/VBZ to/TO increase/VB the/DT amount/NN given/VBN to/TO poorer/JJR countries/NNS through/IN his/PRP$ Millennium/NNP Challenge/NNP Corporation./NNP
The/DT scheme/NN has/VBZ been/VBN set/VBN up/IN to/TO reward/VB developing/VBG countries/NNS that/WDT embrace/NN what/WP the/DT US/PRP considers/VBZ to/TO be/VB good/JJ governance/NN and/CC sound/NN policies./NN
Yet/RB Mr/NNP Bush's/NNP proposed/VBD spending/NN of/IN $3bn/CD on/IN that/DT project/NN is/VBZ well/RB below/IN his/PRP$ initial/JJ promise/NN of/IN $5bn./CD

A/DT key/JJ spending/NN line/NN missing/VBG from/IN proposals/NNS is/VBZ the/DT cost/NN of/IN funding/VBG the/DT administration's/NNS proposed/VBD radical/JJ overhaul/NN of/IN Social/NNP Security/NNP the/DT pensions/NNS programme/NN on/IN which/WDT many/JJ Americans/NNPS rely/VBP for/IN their/PRP$ retirement/NN income./NN

Some/DT experts/NNS believe/VBP this/DT could/MD require/VB borrowing/NN of/IN up/IN to/TO $4.5/CD trillion/CD over/IN a/DT 20-year/JJ period./NN
Neither/DT does/VBZ the/DT budget/NN include/VBP any/DT cash/NN to/TO purchase/VB crude/JJ oil/NN for/IN the/DT US/PRP emergency/VBP petroleum/NN stockpile./NN
Concern/NN over/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN the/DT reserve/NN created/VBN in/IN 1970s/NNS has/VBZ led/VBN to/TO rises/NNS in/IN oil/NN prices/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ year./NN
The/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN will/MD instead/RB continue/VB to/TO fill/VB the/DT reserve/NN by/IN taking/VBG oil/NN -/: rather/RB than/IN cash/NN -/: from/IN energy/NN companies/NNS that/WDT drill/NN under/IN federal/JJ leases./NN

The/DT outline/NN proposes/VBZ reductions/NNS in/IN budgets/NNS at/IN 12/CD out/IN of/IN 23/CD government/NN agencies/NNS including/VBG cuts/NNS of/IN 9.6%/CD at/IN Agriculture/NNP and/CC 5.6%/CD at/IN the/DT Environmental/NNP Protection/NNP Agency./NNP
The/DT spending/NN plan/NN for/IN the/DT year/NN beginning/VBG 1/CD October/NNP is/VBZ banking/NN on/IN a/DT healthy/JJ US/PRP economy/VBP to/TO boost/VB government/NN income/NN by/IN 6.1%/CD to/TO $2.18/CD trillion./NN
Spending/NN is/VBZ forecast/NN to/TO grow/VB by/IN 3.5%/CD to/TO $2.57/CD trillion./NN
But/CC the/DT budget/NN is/VBZ still/RB the/DT tightest/JJ yet/RB under/IN Mr/NNP Bush's/NNP presidency./NN
"In/NN order/NN to/TO sustain/VB our/PRP$ economic/JJ expansion/NN we/PRP must/MD continue/VB pro-growth/JJ policies/NNS and/CC enforce/VB even/RB greater/JJR spending/NN restraint/NN across/IN federal/JJ government"/NN Mr/NNP Bush/NNP said/VBD in/IN his/PRP$ budget/NN message/NN to/TO Congress./NNP
Mr/NNP Bush/NNP has/VBZ promised/VBN to/TO halve/VB the/DT US's/NNP massive/JJ budget/NN deficit/NN within/IN five/CD years./NN
The/DT deficit/NN partly/RB the/DT result/NN of/IN massive/JJ tax/NN cuts/NNS early/RB in/IN Mr/NNP Bush's/NNP presidency/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT key/JJ factor/NN in/IN pushing/VBG the/DT US/PRP dollar/VBP lower./NN
The/DT independent/JJ Congressional/NNP Budget/NNP Office/NNP estimates/VBZ that/IN the/DT shortfall/NN could/MD shrink/VB to/TO little/RB more/JJR than/IN $200bn/CD by/IN 2009/CD returning/VBG to/TO the/DT surpluses/NNS seen/VBN in/IN the/DT late/JJ 1990s/NNS by/IN 2012./CD
But/CC its/PRP$ estimates/NNS depend/VBP on/IN the/DT tax/NN cuts/NNS not/RB being/VBG made/VBN permanent/JJ in/IN line/NN with/IN the/DT promise/NN when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD passed/VBN that/IN they/PRP would/MD "sunset"/VB or/CC disappear/VB in/IN 2010./CD
Most/JJS Republicans/NNPS however/RB want/VBP them/PRP to/TO stay/VB in/IN place./NN
And/CC the/DT figures/NNS also/RB rely/VBP on/IN the/DT "Social/JJ Security/NNP trust/NN fund"/NN -/: the/DT money/NN set/VBN aside/RB to/TO cover/VB the/DT swelling/VBG costs/NNS of/IN retirement/NN pensions/NNS -/: being/VBG offset/VBN against/IN the/DT main/JJ budget/NN deficit./NN
