Labour's/NNP election/NN love-in/JJ

Peace/NN and/CC love/NN have/VBP been/VBN in/IN short/JJ supply/NN in/IN the/DT Labour/NNP party/NN in/IN recent/JJ days./NN

If/IN press/NN reports/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB believed/VBN Alan/NNP Milburn/NNP and/CC Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP have/VBP been/VBN at/IN each/DT other's/NNS throats/NNS over/IN the/DT contents/NNS of/IN Labour's/NNP next/JJ election/NN manifesto./NN
But/CC the/DT pair/NN were/VBD all/DT smiles/VBZ on/IN Tuesday/NNP morning/NN as/IN they/PRP joined/VBD John/NNP Prescott/NNP to/TO unveil/VB Labour's/NNP latest/JJS poster/NN campaign./NN
The/DT event/NN -/: at/IN Old/NNP Billingsgate/NNP Fish/NN Market/NNP on/IN the/DT banks/NNS of/IN the/DT Thames/NNP -/: was/VBD a/DT carefully/RB choreographed/VBN show/NN of/IN unity./NN
And/CC the/DT surest/JJ sign/NN yet/RB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP heading/VBG for/IN a/DT general/JJ election/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ months./NN
It/PRP was/VBD also/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS bizarre/JJ photo/NN opportunities/NNS of/IN recent/JJ years./NN

The/DT first/JJ inkling/NN something/NN slightly/RB odd/RB was/VBD afoot/RB was/VBN when/WRB -/: in/IN place/NN of/IN the/DT soft/JJ rock/NN music/NN normally/RB chosen/VBN for/IN such/JJ occasions/NNS -/: Labour's/NNP speakers/NNS crackled/VBN to/TO life/NN with/IN the/DT sound/NN of/IN Booker/NNP T/NNP and/CC the/DT MGs./NNP
Then/RB a/DT VW/NNP camper/NN van/NNP trundled/VBD into/IN view/NN decked/VBD out/RP in/IN that/DT most/RBS mind-bending/JJ of/IN psychedelic/JJ messages/NNS -/: "lowest/JJ mortgage/NN rate/NN for/IN 40/CD years"./NN
As/IN the/DT side-door/NN slid/VBD open/JJ it/PRP looked/VBD for/IN one/CD glorious/JJ moment/NN as/IN if/IN the/DT Cabinet/NNP had/VBD decided/VBN to/TO bury/VB their/PRP$ differences/NNS and/CC go/VB on/IN the/DT road/NN together/RB Scooby/NNP Doo-style./NNP
But/CC sadly/RB it/PRP wasn't/NN the/DT Cabinet/NNP who/WP had/VBD raided/VBN the/DT dressing-up/JJ box/NN -/: just/RB six/CD rather/RB ill-at-ease/JJ looking/NN Labour/NNP students./NN
Two/CD were/VBD dressed/VBN as/IN Regency/NNP dandies/NNS -/: to/TO unveil/VB a/DT poster/NN trumpeting/VBG "the/NN longest/JJS period/NN of/IN economic/JJ growth/NN for/IN 200/CD years"./NN
Another/DT pair/NN of/IN students/NNS were/VBD in/IN a/DT Beatle/NNP wig/NN and/CC Sgt/NNP Pepper/NN jacket/NN to/TO highlight/VB the/DT "lowest/JJ interest/NN rates/NNS since/IN the/DT 1960s"./CD

The/DT remaining/VBG two/CD were/VBD dressed/VBN in/IN a/DT vague/JJ approximation/NN of/IN disco/NN chic/JJ to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT "lowest/JJ unemployment/NN since/IN the/DT seventies"./NN

The/DT politicians/NNS -/: led/VBN out/RP by/IN John/NNP Prescott/NNP -/: were/VBD soberly-suited/JJ as/IN always./NN
The/DT event/NN may/MD have/VB been/VBN designed/VBN to/TO highlight/VB Labour's/NNP economic/JJ success/NN under/IN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP but/CC there/EX was/VBD little/JJ doubt/NN who/WP was/VBD in/IN charge./NN
The/DT chancellor/NN walked/VBD side-by-side/RB with/IN Mr/NNP Milburn/NNP pointedly/RB exchanging/VBG chit/NN chat/NN as/IN they/PRP approached/VBD the/DT microphone./NN
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD Mr/NNP Milburn/NNP who/WP took/VBD centre/NN stage/NN speaking/NN of/IN the/DT "positive/JJ campaign"/NN the/DT party/NN hoped/VBN to/TO stage/VB in/IN the/DT "coming/VBG weeks/NNS and/CC months"./NN

The/DT mobile/JJ poster/NN vans/NNS would/MD "let/VB people/NNS know/VBP Britain/NNP is/VBZ working/VBG again"./NN
Mr/NNP Brown/NNP repeated/VBD the/DT familiar/JJ mantras/NNS displayed/VBN on/IN the/DT posters/NNS and/CC spoke/VBD of/IN Labour's/NNP "shared/VBD purpose"/NN and/CC "united/VBN dedication"./NN
It/PRP was/VBD left/VBN to/TO Mr/NNP Prescott/NNP to/TO pay/VB glowing/JJ tribute/NN to/TO the/DT chancellor's/NNS record/NN and/CC in/IN a/DT final/JJ flourish/NN to/TO produce/VB his/PRP$ famous/JJ pledge/NN card/NN from/IN 1997/CD claiming/VBG Labour/NNP has/VBZ met/VBN all/DT of/IN its/PRP$ promises./NN
The/DT event/NN was/VBD carefully/RB stage-managed/JJ to/TO underline/VB Cabinet/NNP unity./NN
And/CC more/RBR specifically/RB to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT "central/JJ role"/NN Mr/NNP Brown/NNP will/MD play/VB in/IN the/DT election/NN campaign/NN despite/IN being/VBG sidelined/VBN as/IN campaign/NN chief/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Milburn./NNP

But/CC keen/JJ students/NNS of/IN body/NN language/NN will/MD have/VB had/VBN a/DT field/NN day./NN
There/EX was/VBD much/JJ forced/VBN smiling/VBG for/IN the/DT cameras/NNS but/CC only/RB Mr/NNP Prescott/NNP who/WP revels/VBZ in/IN such/JJ occasions/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB truly/RB enjoying/VBG himself./NN
Mr/NNP Milburn/NNP made/VBD a/DT point/NN of/IN turning/VBG to/TO face/VB the/DT chancellor/NN as/IN he/PRP spoke/VBD nodding/VBG thoughtfully./NN
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD the/DT former/JJ health/NN secretary's/NNS final/JJ gesture/NN placing/VBG an/DT arm/NN on/IN Mr/NNP Brown's/NNP back/RB as/IN they/PRP walked/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT microphones/NNS which/WDT was/VBD perhaps/RB the/DT most/JJS telling./NN
Thanks/NNS for/IN dropping/VBG by/IN Gordon/NNP he/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN saying./VBG
