Kilroy/NN launches/NNS 'Veritas'/NN party/NN

Ex-BBC/NN chat/NN show/NN host/NN and/CC East/NNP Midlands/NNP MEP/NNP Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP said/VBD he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO "change/VB the/DT face/NN of/IN British/JJ politics"/NN as/IN he/PRP launched/VBD his/PRP$ new/JJ party./NN
Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP who/WP recently/RB quit/VBD the/DT UK/NNP Independence/NNP Party/NNP said/VBD "our/NN country"/NN was/VBD being/VBG "stolen/NN from/IN us"/NN by/IN mass/NN immigration./NN
He/PRP told/VBD a/DT London/NNP news/NN conference/NN that/IN Veritas/NNP -/: Latin/NNP for/IN "truth"/NN -/: would/MD avoid/VB the/DT old/JJ parties'/NN "lies/NN and/CC spin"./NN
UKIP/NNP leader/NN Roger/NNP Knapman/NNP says/VBZ he/PRP is/VBZ glad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT back/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk./NNP

Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP promised/VBD a/DT "firm/NN but/CC fair"/NN policy/NN on/IN immigration/NN and/CC said/VBD they/PRP hoped/VBD to/TO contest/VB most/JJS seats/NNS at/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ general/JJ election./NN
He/PRP said/VBD Veritas/NNP would/MD also/RB announce/VB detailed/JJ policies/NNS on/IN crime/NN tax/NN pensions/NNS health/NN and/CC defence/NN over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks./NN
Labour/NNP campaign/NN spokesman/NN Fraser/NNP Kemp/NNP said/VBD Veritas/NNP was/VBD joining/VBG "an/NN already/RB crowded/VBD field/NN on/IN the/DT right/NN of/IN British/JJ politics"./NN
On/IN Thursday/NNP Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO announce/VB which/WDT constituency/NN he/PRP will/MD run/VB in/IN at/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election/NN -/: that/WDT will/MD come/VB amid/IN speculation/NN he/PRP has/VBZ his/PRP$ sights/NNS set/VBN on/IN Defence/NNP Secretary/NNP Geoff/NNP Hoon's/NNP Ashfield/NNP seat./NN
He/PRP was/VBD joined/VBN in/IN the/DT new/JJ venture/NN by/IN one/CD of/IN UKIP's/NNP two/CD London/NNP Assembly/NNP members/NNS Damien/NNP Hockney/NNP who/WP is/VBZ now/RB Veritas'/NNP deputy/NN leader./NN
UKIP's/NNP chairman/NN Petrina/NNP Holdsworth/NNP has/VBZ said/VBD the/DT group/NN will/MD just/RB be/VB a/DT parody/NN of/IN the/DT party/NN the/DT men/NNS have/VBP left./NN

Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP quit/VBD UKIP/NNP last/JJ week/NN after/IN months/NNS of/IN tension/NN as/IN he/PRP vied/VBD unsuccessfully/RB for/IN the/DT leadership/NN of/IN that/DT party./NN
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD ashamed/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT UKIP/NNP whose/WP$ leadership/NN had/VBD "gone/JJ AWOL"/NNP after/IN the/DT great/JJ opportunity/NN offered/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ third/JJ place/NN at/IN last/JJ June's/JJ European/JJ elections./NN
"While/NNP UKIP/NNP has/VBZ turned/VBN its/PRP$ back/RB on/IN the/DT British/JJ people/NNS I/PRP shall/MD not"/VB he/PRP said./VB
"I/NN will/MD be/VB standing/NN at/IN the/DT next/JJ general/JJ election./NN
I/PRP shall/MD be/VB leading/VBG a/DT vigorous/JJ campaign/NN for/IN the/DT causes/NNS I/PRP believe/VBP in./NN
"And/NN unlike/IN the/DT old/JJ parties/NNS we/PRP shall/MD be/VB honest/JJ open/JJ and/CC straight."/NN

Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP also/RB left/VBD UKIP/NNP saying/VBG Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP would/MD "deliver/VB better"/NN as/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN a/DT Eurosceptic/NNP party./NN
A/DT spokesman/NN for/IN UKIP/NNP called/VBD on/IN Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP to/TO quit/VB the/DT London/NNP Assembly./NNP
The/DT party/NN asserts/VBZ that/IN Mr/NNP Hockney/NNP "has/NN a/DT moral/JJ obligation/NN if/IN not/RB a/DT legal/JJ one"/NN to/TO stand/VB down./NN
Its/PRP$ leader/NN Roger/NNP Knapman/NNP has/VBZ said/VBN he/PRP is/VBZ glad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT back/NN of/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk./NNP
"He/NN has/VBZ remarkable/JJ ability/NN to/TO influence/VB people/NNS but/CC sadly/RB after/IN the/DT [European]/NN election/NN it/PRP became/VBD clear/JJ that/IN he/PRP was/VBD more/RBR interested/JJ in/IN the/DT Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP Party/NNP than/IN the/DT UK/NNP Independence/NNP Party/NNP so/IN it/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ knowing/NN him/PRP now/RB 'goodbye'"/VBP he/PRP said./VB
UKIP/NN officials/NNS also/RB argue/VBP Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN "straightforward"/NN in/IN attacking/VBG the/DT party/NN he/PRP once/RB wanted/VBD to/TO lead./VB

Veritas?/NNP It's/NNP the/DT BNP/NNP in/IN an/DT expensive/JJ suit/NN

It's/VBG all/DT well/RB and/CC good/JJ Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP claiming/VBG that/DT 'Veritas'/NN is/VBZ a/DT party/NN that/DT doesn't/NN believe/VBP in/IN "lies/NN and/CC spin"/NN but/CC the/DT truth/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN is/VBZ its/PRP$ completely/RB useless/JJ due/JJ to/TO proportional/JJ representation/NN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT chance/NN that/DT 'Veritas'/NN will/MD have/VB any/DT chance/NN in/IN claiming/VBG power/NN and/CC change/VB the/DT two-horse/JJ race/NN trend./NN
In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN this/DT is/VBZ just/RB a/DT publicity/NN stunt/NN which/WDT has/VBZ just/RB been/VBN used/VBN as/IN a/DT smoke-screen/NN for/IN his/PRP$ anti-Islamism/JJ slurs/NNS which/WDT got/VBD him/PRP sacked/VBD from/IN the/DT television./NN

I/PRP think/VBP that/IN his/PRP$ views/NNS regarding/VBG immigration/NN are/VBP shared/VBN by/IN many./NN
It/PRP really/RB is/VBZ time/NN that/IN the/DT UK/NNP government/NN ceased/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT paper/NN tiger/NN on/IN this/DT issue./NN
In/IN addition/NN as/IN an/DT Ashfield/NNP constituent/NN I/PRP would/MD be/VB more/JJR than/IN interested/JJ in/IN Kilroy/NNP -Silk/JJ opposing/NN Geoff/NNP Hoon/NNP

Good/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT parties/NNS of/IN the/DT right/NN splintering/VBG in/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT parties/NNS of/IN the/DT left/NN have/VBP always/RB done./VB
Let's/NNP hope/NN Kilroy-Silk/NNP UKIP/NNP and/CC the/DT euro-sceptic/JJ wing/NN of/IN the/DT Tory/NNP Party/NNP all/DT fade/JJ further/RBR into/IN obscurity/NN so/IN we/PRP can/MD have/VB some/DT truth/NN in/IN the/DT debate/NN about/IN Europe./NNP
We/PRP benefit/VBP enormously/RB from/IN our/PRP$ membership/NN of/IN the/DT EU/NNP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Europe/NNP leading/VBG it/PRP and/CC driving/VBG it/PRP to/TO where/WRB we/PRP as/IN a/DT country/NN want/NN to/TO go/VB not/RB running/VBG away/RB from/IN it./NN

All/DT mouth/NN and/CC trousers./NN
A/DT clown./NN
Trouble/NN is/VBZ any/DT votes/NNS he/PRP collects/VBZ may/MD just/RB end/VB up/RP helping/VBG New/NNP Labour/NNP into/IN a/DT third/JJ term./NN

Whatever/WDT Kilroy-Silk/NNP and/CC UKIP/NNP do/VBP none/NN of/IN their/PRP$ anti-European/JJ policies/NNS have/VBP any/DT relevance/NN outside/JJ middle/NN England./NNP
This/DT new/JJ party/NN might/MD gain/VB support/NN from/IN right-wing/JJ England/NNP but/CC will/MD have/VB little/JJ impact/NN in/IN Wales/NNP or/CC Scotland./NNP

Hopefully/RB this/DT all/PDT this/DT fighting/NN within/IN euro-sceptic/JJ parties/NNS will/MD allow/VB them/PRP to/TO slip/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN and/CC get/VB people/NNS voting/VBP for/IN real/JJ political/JJ parties/NNS which/WDT address/VBP more/JJR than/IN one/CD issue./NN
England/NNP needs/VBZ Europe/NNP to/TO survive/VB and/CC as/RB soon/RB as/IN people/NNS realise/VBP this/DT the/DT better/JJR we/PRP can't/VBP rely/NN on/IN the/DT USA/NNP forever/RB

At/IN last/JJ an/DT impetus/NN for/IN increasing/VBG the/DT likely/JJ 40%/CD turn/NN out/RP for/IN the/DT election./NN
The/DT electorate/NN is/VBZ disillusioned/JJ with/IN British/JJ politics./NN
Kilroy/NNP has/VBZ one/CD agenda/NN -/: the/DT UK/NNP -/: and/CC I'll/NNP be/VBP voting/NN for/IN him./NN

Both/DT UKIP/NNP and/CC RK-S/NNP are/VBP representatives/NNS of/IN small-mindedness/NN and/CC a/DT lack/NN of/IN vision/NN for/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN humankind./NN
The/DT interests/NNS of/IN humanity/NN and/CC the/DT world/NN lie/NN so/RB much/JJ beyond/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN these/DT people's/NNS bickering/NN that/IN who/WP in/IN the/DT overall/JJ scheme/NN of/IN things/NNS really/RB cares/VBZ about/IN their/PRP$ petty/NN tiff?/NN

Many/JJ people/NNS believe/VBP you/PRP Kilroy./NNP
You/PRP may/MD even/RB believe/VB yourself/PRP but/CC switching/VBG horses/NNS midstream/NN and/CC then/RB bad/JJ mouthing/NN the/DT steed/VBN that/WDT got/VBD you/PRP halfway/VBP seriously/RB diminishes/VBZ your/PRP$ credibility./NN

The/DT very/JJ idea/NN of/IN political/JJ parties/NNS born/VBD out/IN of/IN such/JJ negative/JJ feelings/NNS as/IN Euroscepticism/NNP or/CC British/JJ Supremacy/NN is/VBZ nauseating./NN
One/CD can/MD only/RB hope/VB the/DT public/JJ recognise/NN these/DT extremists/NNS for/IN what/WP they/PRP are/VBP and/CC shun/VB them/PRP at/IN the/DT polls./NN

I've/NNP always/RB thought/VBD that/IN Kilroy-Silk/NNP was/VBD a/DT self-publicising/NN egotist/NN and/CC this/DT news/NN does/VBZ absolutely/RB nothing/NN to/TO alter/VB my/PRP$ opinion./NN

Brilliant/JJ about/IN time/NN this/DT country/NN had/VBD a/DT plausible/JJ party/NN

Having/VBG seen/VBN the/DT recent/JJ BBC/NNP 3/CD documentary/NN and/CC witnessed/VBD the/DT thoroughly/RB disgraceful/JJ chauvinistic/JJ behaviour/NN of/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN senior/JJ UKIP/NNP figures/VBZ I/PRP can/MD well/RB understand/VB why/WRB Kilroy-Silk/NNP feels/VBZ embarrassed/JJ to/TO be/VB associated/VBN with/IN such/JJ people./NN
Hopefully/RB the/DT UKIP/NNP members/NNS who/WP are/VBP interested/JJ in/IN the/DT political/JJ debate/NN will/MD support/VB his/PRP$ action./NN

Fantastic/JJ news./NN
Pro-Europeans/NNP now/RB have/VBP far/RB less/JJR to/TO worry/VB about/IN from/IN the/DT right./NN
The/DT Conservatives/NNS are/VBP as/RB confused/JJ as/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN since/IN the/DT mid-1990s/NNS and/CC the/DT extreme/JJ anti-Europeans/NNS are/VBP fracturing/VBG themselves/PRP into/IN splinter/NN groups/NNS that/DT split/NN any/DT votes/NNS they/PRP might/MD get/VB in/IN local/JJ European/JJ and/CC general/JJ elections./NN
Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk's/NNP ego/NN and/CC vanity/NN are/VBP his/PRP$ own/JJ (and/NN his/PRP$ supporters')/NN worst/JJS enemy./NN

As/IN a/DT euro-enthusiast/JJ I/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB more/RBR delighted/JJ by/IN Kilroy-Silk's/NNP behaviour./NN
He/PRP took/VBD a/DT party/NN that/WDT was/VBD just/RB building/VBG up/RP a/DT head/NN of/IN steam/NN and/CC having/VBG exposed/VBN it/PRP to/TO ridicule/VB by/IN attempting/VBG a/DT coup-d'etat/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ now/RB setting/VBG about/IN the/DT serious/JJ business/NN of/IN dividing/VBG it/PRP in/IN two./NN
The/DT closer/JJR to/TO straight-down-the-middle/VB the/DT better/JJR as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP am/VBP concerned/VBN but/CC in/IN any/DT eventuality/NN the/DT two/CD sceptic/JJ parties/NNS will/MD exhaust/VB their/PRP$ energies/NNS fighting/VBG each/DT other./NN

If/IN every/DT politician/NN with/IN ambitions/NNS to/TO lead/VB their/PRP$ party/NN resorted/VBN to/TO forming/VBG their/PRP$ own/JJ for/IN that/DT purpose/NN we'd/NN have/VBP ballot/NN papers/NNS a/DT mile/NN long/JJ You've/NNP got/VBD to/TO hand/VB it/PRP to/TO Kilroy-Silk/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ sheer/JJ arrogance/NN and/CC supreme/JJ self-belief./NN

Whilst/NNP not/RB being/VBG a/DT great/JJ fan/NN of/IN Kilroy/NNP I/PRP do/VBP agree/VB with/IN his/PRP$ comments/NNS about/IN the/DT UKIP/NNP leadership/NN and/CC like/IN him/PRP I/PRP am/VBP also/RB leaving/VBG UKIP./NNP
I/PRP believe/VBP countless/JJ opportunities/NNS have/VBP been/VBN lost/VBN to/TO discredit/VB the/DT EU/NNP and/CC to/TO show/VB our/PRP$ people/NNS what/WP belonging/VBG to/TO the/DT EU/NNP really/RB means./NN
The/DT EU's/NNP comments/NNS last/JJ week/NN about/IN Michael/NNP Howard's/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO reform/VB immigration/NN show/NN how/WRB little/JJ we/PRP govern/VBP our/PRP$ own/JJ country/NN when/WRB they/PRP can/MD turn/VB round/NN and/CC say/VB immigration/NN is/VBZ a/DT matter/NN for/IN the/DT EU/NNP and/CC not/RB individual/JJ member/NN states./NN
The/DT sooner/JJR we/PRP leave/VBP this/DT corrupt/JJ super-state/JJ the/DT better/JJR

Does/VBZ anyone/NN else/RB think/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ironic/JJ that/IN Euro-Sceptic/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ used/VBN a/DT Latin/NNP name/NN for/IN his/PRP$ new/JJ party/NN rather/RB than/IN a/DT 'good/NN old/JJ British'/NNP name?/NN Is/VBZ this/DT indicative/NN of/IN the/DT man/NN -/: contradictory/JJ vain/JJ and/CC pompous?/NN

I/PRP think/VBP Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ got/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ point./NN
British/JJ politics/NNS has/VBZ become/VBN too/RB PC/NN and/CC as/IN a/DT result/NN has/VBZ no/DT straight/JJ talking/VBG honest/JJ strong/JJ politicians./NN
They/PRP are/VBP all/DT interested/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ careers/NNS and/CC not/RB the/DT people/NNS who/WP put/VBP them/PRP in/IN power./NN
As/IN a/DT result/NN I/PRP feel/VBP our/PRP$ democracy/NN is/VBZ being/VBG abused/VBN and/CC I/PRP want/VBP it/PRP stopped./NN
If/IN Mr/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP lives/NNS up/IN to/TO half/NN his/PRP$ promises/NNS he/PRP will/MD get/VB my/PRP$ vote./NN

Honestly/RB who/WP really/RB cares?/VBP Man/NN with/IN tan/NN leaves/VBZ party/NN with/IN no/DT plan/NN to/TO set/VB up/RP party/NN with/IN no/DT idea./NN

As/IN one/CD of/IN Kilroy-Silk's/NNP East/NNP Midlands/NNP constituents/NNS I/PRP hope/VBP those/DT who/WP voted/VBD for/IN him/PRP are/VBP proud/JJ to/TO have/VB been/VBN taken/VBN in/IN by/IN such/JJ charming/JJ vacuity./NN
I/PRP feel/VBP insulted/VBN by/IN having/VBG him/PRP represent/VB me/PRP in/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament./NNP

UKIP/NNP tried/VBD hard/JJ to/TO accommodate/VB Robert/NNP Kilroy/NNP Silk/NNP but/CC he/PRP made/VBD it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN only/RB control/NN of/IN it/PRP would/MD satisfy/VB him./NN
Someone/NN so/RB keen/JJ on/IN complete/JJ control/NN was/VBD bound/VBN to/TO fall/VB foul/JJ of/IN UKIP's/NNP democratic/JJ nature./NN

Kilroy/NNP is/VBZ an/DT able/JJ communicator/NN and/CC a/DT capable/JJ politician/NN in/IN exactly/RB the/DT way/NN those/DT who/WP lead/VBP UKIP/NNP are/VBP not./NN
He/PRP tried/VBD to/TO make/VB it/PRP work/VB but/CC they/PRP didn't/VBP seem/VBP to/TO want/VB to/TO grow/VB up./NN
He/PRP was/VBD left/VBN in/IN the/DT position/NN of/IN having/VBG to/TO defend/VB their/PRP$ gaffes/NNS to/TO the/DT media./NN
This/DT new/JJ party/NN seems/VBZ a/DT logical/JJ next/JJ step/NN for/IN Kilroy./NNP
Good/JJ luck/NN to/TO the/DT man/NN I/PRP say./VBP

Oh/UH please/VB This/DT is/VBZ an/DT amusing/JJ irrelevance./NN
There/EX is/VBZ absolutely/RB no/DT chance/NN of/IN either/DT of/IN these/DT parties/NNS communicating/VBG a/DT sensible/JJ and/CC constructive/JJ 'Eurosceptic'/NN argument./NN
They/PRP will/MD play/VB a/DT key/JJ part/NN in/IN winning/VBG the/DT country/NN round/NN to/TO the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT reformed/JJ more/RBR democratic/JJ more/RBR dynamic/JJ Europe/NNP Union./NNP
Future/JJ generations/NNS will/MD thank/VB him/PRP for/IN his/PRP$ ridiculousness./NN

The/DT refreshing/VBG thing/NN about/IN Robert/NNP is/VBZ that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ open/JJ honest/JJ and/CC straight./NN
What/WP other/JJ politician/NN can/MD claim/VB this./NN
I/PRP have/VBP a/DT suspicion/NN that/IN he/PRP talks/VBZ for/IN a/DT larger/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT electorate/NN that/IN his/PRP$ critics/NNS would/MD like./VB
I/PRP shall/MD be/VB voting/NN for/IN him./NN

The/DT electorate/NN of/IN the/DT East/NNP Midlands/NNP voted/VBD not/RB for/IN Kilroy-Silk/NNP but/CC for/IN the/DT UKIP./NNP
Kilroy-Silk/NNP was/VBD made/VBN an/DT MEP/NNP because/IN of/IN his/PRP$ position/NN on/IN the/DT UKIP's/NNP party/NN list./NN
He/PRP has/VBZ no/DT mandate/NN to/TO represent/VB the/DT area/NN and/CC should/MD resign/VB from/IN the/DT European/NNP Parliament./NNP

I/PRP wouldn't/VBP write/NN off/RP Kilroy-Silk./NNP
While/IN he's/NNS a/DT clown/NN and/CC a/DT one/CD man/NN band/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN he's/NNS a/DT populist/JJ and/CC that's/NNS always/RB dangerous.The/VBP man/NN clearly/RB has/VBZ an/DT enormous/JJ ego/NN and/CC looking/VBG at/IN our/PRP$ current/JJ political/JJ masters/NNS that/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT factors/NNS in/IN success./NN

Good/JJ luck/NN to/TO Kilroy/NNP though/IN I/PRP think/VBP he/PRP is/VBZ doing/VBG more/JJR harm/NN than/IN good/JJ for/IN both/DT his/PRP$ new/JJ party/NN and/CC UKIP/NNP because/IN their/PRP$ vote/NN base/NN is/VBZ not/RB strong/JJ enough/RB for/IN both/DT parties/NNS to/TO be/VB successful/JJ and/CC at/IN the/DT moment/NN UKIP/NNP have/VBP the/DT upper/JJ hand/NN while/IN Veritas/NNP are/VBP starting/VBG from/IN square/JJ one/CD and/CC fighting/VBG a/DT somewhat/RB uphill/JJ battle./NN

The/DT man/NN I/PRP once/RB found/VBD cringe/NN worthy/JJ on/IN Day/NNP time/NN TV/NN could/MD well/RB turn/VB out/RP to/TO be/VB my/PRP$ country's/NNS knight/NN in/IN shining/VBG armour./NN
He/PRP expresses/VBZ views/NNS which/WDT are/VBP now/RB more/JJR than/IN common/JJ amongst/IN society/NN today/NN -/: but/CC people/NNS are/VBP almost/RB too/RB scared/VBN to/TO express/VB them./NN
Kilroy/NNP Silk/NNP has/VBZ secured/VBN my/PRP$ vote/NN and/CC many/JJ more/JJR like/IN me./NN
What's/NNP more/JJR I/PRP look/VBP forward/RB to/TO the/DT day/NN when/WRB he/PRP claims/VBZ victory/NN wrecks/NNS the/DT EU/NNP and/CC rescues/VBZ my/PRP$ great/JJ nation.../NN
without/IN a/DT hair/NN out/IN of/IN place/NN and/CC his/PRP$ tan/NN as/RB perfect/JJ as/IN ever/RB

Great/NNP Stuff./NNP
The/DT longer/RB the/DT UK/NNP dithers/NNS over/IN Europe/NNP the/DT richer/JJR we/PRP in/IN Ireland/NNP become/VB as/IN the/DT only/JJ English-speaking/JJ country/NN fully/RB committed/VBD to/TO Europe./NNP
Oh/UH and/CC send/VB us/PRP over/IN those/DT hard-working/JJ immigrants/NNS -/: our/PRP$ economy/NN needs/VBZ them./NN

This/DT is/VBZ just/RB what/WP the/DT Europhiles/NNP pray/NN for./NN
As/IN the/DT main/JJ Eurosceptic/NNP party/NN UKIP/NNP should/MD try/VB to/TO resolve/VB its/PRP$ differences/NNS with/IN Kilroy/NNP to/TO show/VB a/DT united/VBN front/NN and/CC give/VB the/DT UK/NNP public/VBD a/DT serious/JJ political/JJ voice/NN against/IN Europe./NNP
Having/VBG multiple/JJ parties/NNS with/IN the/DT same/JJ view/NN point/NN just/RB splits/VBZ the/DT vote/NN further./NN

Thank/VB goodness/NN that/IN Kilroy-Silk/NNP has/VBZ gone/VBN -/: now/RB UKIP/NNP at/IN least/JJS has/VBZ a/DT chance/NN in/IN the/DT election/NN

It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB sad/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN Britain/NNP regaining/VBG its/PRP$ proper/JJ relationship/NN with/IN Europe/NNP damaged/VBD by/IN this/DT split/VBN within/IN UKIP./NNP
Robert/NNP Kilroy-Silk/NNP could/MD have/VB a/DT lot/NN to/TO offer./VB
Instead/RB we/PRP have/VBP a/DT split/NN party/NN and/CC a/DT damaged/VBN cause./NN
Under/IN the/DT present/JJ electoral/JJ system/NN people/NNS must/MD work/VB together/RB and/CC small/JJ parties/NNS have/VBP no/DT hope/NN of/IN representation./NN
Last/JJ summer/NN UKIP/NNP achieved/VBD a/DT major/JJ advance/NN partly/RB and/CC only/RB partly/RB due/JJ to/TO Kilroy-Silk./NNP
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ shame/NN this/DT has/VBZ been/VBN dissipated/VBN in/IN in-fighting./JJ

UKIP/NNP has/VBZ a/DT wide/JJ platform/NN of/IN policies/NNS not/RB just/RB withdrawal/NN from/IN the/DT EU./NNP
This/DT Kilroy-Silk/NNP conveniently/RB ignores/VBZ in/IN the/DT comments/NNS surrounding/VBG the/DT launch/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ party./NN
Neither/DT the/DT English/NNP Democrats/NNPS nor/CC the/DT New/NNP Party/NNP were/VBD interested/JJ in/IN letting/VBG him/PRP join/VB them/PRP and/CC take/VB over/RP their/PRP$ leadership/NN speaks/VBZ volumes./NN
Veritas/NNP is/VBZ the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN for/IN Kilroy-Silk./NNP

If/IN he/PRP believes/VBZ in/IN truth/NN and/CC democracy/NN then/RB he/PRP and/CC the/DT two/CD assembly/NN members/NNS should/MD resign/VB and/CC force/VB a/DT by-elections/NNS to/TO stand/VB on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ platform/NN rather/RB than/IN this/DT backdoor/NN approach/NN to/TO politics/NNS of/IN being/VBG elected/VBN for/IN one/CD party/NN then/RB defecting/VBG to/TO another./VB

So/RB UKIP/NNP was/VBD good/JJ enough/RB for/IN him/PRP to/TO lead/VB not/RB good/JJ enough/RB for/IN him/PRP to/TO follow/VB

Interesting/JJ that/IN a/DT party/NN committed/VBN to/TO plain/JJ speaking/NN should/MD have/VB a/DT Latin/NNP name/NN

Every/DT opinion/NN poll/NN points/NNS to/TO an/DT overwhelming/JJ anti-Europe/JJ feeling/NN in/IN this/DT country./NN
Kilroy-Silk/NNP could/MD be/VB on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN something/NN huge/JJ if/IN he/PRP can/MD broaden/VB his/PRP$ appeal/NN beyond/IN this/DT one/CD issue./NN
He/PRP is/VBZ an/DT extremely/RB able/JJ communicator/NN with/IN years/NNS of/IN political/JJ experience./NN
We/PRP wants/VBZ quality/NN schools/NNS top/JJ hospitals/NNS clean/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ public/JJ transport/NN punishments/NNS that/WDT fit/VBP the/DT crime/NN limited/JJ asylum/NN a/DT purge/NN on/IN bureaucracy/NN and/CC less/JJR taxes./NN
It/PRP needs/VBZ courage/NN and/CC honesty/NN two/CD qualities/NNS sadly/RB lacking/VBG in/IN our/PRP$ politicians./NN
