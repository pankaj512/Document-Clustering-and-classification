The/DT first/JJ minister's/NNS statement/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD okay/JJ to/TO get/VB drunk/JJ "once/NN in/IN a/DT while"/NN has/VBZ diverted/VBN attention/NN from/IN the/DT real/JJ issues/NNS it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN claimed./NN

Jack/NNP Law/NN chief/NN executive/NN of/IN Alcohol/NN Focus/VB Scotland/NNP said/VBD Jack/NNP McConnell's/NNP comment/VB was/VBD "ill-advised"./JJ
The/DT media/NNS attention/NN had/VBD helped/VBN to/TO move/VB the/DT focus/NN from/IN Scotland's/NNP binge/NN drinking/NN problems/NNS Mr/NNP Law/NNP said./NN
Scotsman/NNP journalist/NN Hamish/NNP MacDonell/NNP said/VBD he/PRP believed/VBD the/DT bigger/JJR picture/NN had/VBD been/VBN "obscured"/NN by/IN the/DT remark./NN
Mr/NNP McConnell/NNP was/VBD speaking/VBG on/IN Monday/NNP to/TO more/JJR than/IN 100/CD secondary/JJ pupils/NNS from/IN schools/NNS in/IN the/DT Highlands/NNP about/IN the/DT problems/NNS of/IN binge/NN drinking/NN and/CC drink/NN promotions./NN

The/DT one-sentence/JJ comment/NN was/VBD immediately/RB criticised/VBN by/IN the/DT Scottish/NNP National/NNP Party/NNP which/WDT accused/VBD him/PRP of/IN encouraging/VBG young/JJ people/NNS to/TO get/VB drunk./NN
But/CC the/DT Scottish/NNP Executive/NNP has/VBZ insisted/VBN Mr/NNP McConnell/NNP was/VBD speaking/VBG about/IN adults/NNS and/CC his/PRP$ comments/NNS were/VBD "a/NN recognition/NN that/IN people/NNS will/MD get/VB drunk"./NN
Mr/NNP MacDonell/NNP political/JJ editor/NN of/IN The/DT Scotsman/NNP said/VBD "I/NN think/VBP we/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB right/JJ at/IN the/DT outset/NN that/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT very/RB stupid/JJ and/CC ill-advised/JJ remark/NN by/IN the/DT first/JJ minister./NN
"If/NN you/PRP come/VBP out/RP with/IN something/NN like/IN this/DT saying/NN that/IN by/IN all/DT means/NNS get/VB drunk/JJ then/RB you/PRP will/MD be/VB pilloried/VBN for/IN it."/NN However/RB he/PRP added/VBD that/IN "perhaps/NN Mr/NNP McConnell/NNP could/MD feel/VB rightly/RB aggrieved/VBN about/IN the/DT coverage"./NN

Mr/NNP MacDonell/NNP said/VBD "I/NN think/VBP the/DT problem/NN here/RB is/VBZ that/IN he/PRP did/VBD say/VB a/DT lot/NN more/JJR things/NNS about/IN binge/NN drinking/NN and/CC under/IN age/NN drinking./NN
"But/NN that/IN whole/JJ side/NN of/IN things/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN lost/VBN in/IN the/DT furore/NN over/IN one/CD sentence./NN
I/PRP understand/VBP why/WRB but/CC I/PRP think/VBP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT much/RB bigger/JJR message/NN here/RB that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN obscured."/NN Mr/NNP Law/NNP from/IN voluntary/JJ body/NN Alcohol/NN Focus/VB Scotland/NNP believed/VBD damage/NN had/VBD been/VBN done/VBN to/TO Scotland's/NNP fight/NN against/IN binge/NN drinking./NN
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP accepted/VBD that/IN young/JJ people/NNS drank/VBP and/CC they/PRP did/VBD have/VB problems/NNS with/IN drink./NN
Mr/NNP Law/NN added/VBD "I/NN think/VBP the/DT remark/NN was/VBD ill-advised/JJ -/: but/CC these/DT remarks/NNS are/VBP blown/VBN out/IN of/IN all/DT proportion/NN and/CC they/PRP so/RB easily/RB misrepresent/VB what/WP we/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO do/VB in/IN Scotland./NNP

"We/NN don't/NN want/VBP to/TO preach/VB to/TO young/JJ people/NNS but/CC we/PRP need/VBP to/TO acknowledge/VB that/IN they/PRP do/VBP drink/NN problematically./NN
"This/NN diverts/VBZ us/PRP from/IN the/DT real/JJ issues/NNS which/WDT are/VBP about/IN promoting/VBG responsibility/NN and/CC reducing/VBG harm/NN and/CC indeed/RB tackling/VBG our/PRP$ drinking/NN culture/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT culture/NN about/IN binge/NN drinking/NN and/CC drunkenness."/NN He/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD vital/JJ that/IN young/JJ people/NNS were/VBD properly/RB informed/VBN about/IN the/DT risks/NNS incurred/VBN to/TO themselves/PRP and/CC others/NNS when/WRB they/PRP got/VBD drunk./NN
Mr/NNP MacDonell/NNP said/VBD that/IN the/DT first/JJ minister/NN should/MD know/VB by/IN now/RB that/IN if/IN he/PRP said/VBD things/NNS which/WDT were/VBD "off/NN the/DT mark"/NN they/PRP were/VBD bound/VBN to/TO "come/VB back/RB and/CC bite/VB him"./NN
He/PRP added/VBD "Here/NN Mr/NNP McConnell/NNP was/VBD talking/VBG in/IN the/DT Highlands/NNP to/TO 100/CD teenagers/NNS and/CC every/DT word/NN he/PRP said/VBD was/VBD put/VBN out/RP on/IN a/DT webcast/NN by/IN the/DT Scottish/NNP Executive/NNP and/CC then/RB looked/VBD at/IN by/IN other/JJ politicians/NNS and/CC reporters./NN
"I/NN think/VBP in/IN this/DT instance/NN he/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN really/RB good/JJ things/NNS and/CC he/PRP will/MD be/VB regretting/VBG this/DT remark."/NN

The/DT Scottish/NNP National/NNP Party's/NNP Holyrood/NNP leader/NN Nicola/NNP Sturgeon/NNP wrote/VBD to/TO Mr/NNP McConnell/NNP on/IN Tuesday/NNP accusing/VBG him/PRP of/IN an/DT error/NN of/IN judgement/NN and/CC calling/VBG for/IN him/PRP to/TO apologise/VB for/IN his/PRP$ "ill-judged/JJ comment"/NN and/CC withdraw/VB it/PRP immediately./NN
In/IN a/DT furious/JJ response/NN the/DT first/JJ minister/NN said/VBD his/PRP$ comments/NNS had/VBD been/VBN distorted/VBN and/CC taken/VBN out/IN of/IN context./NN
He/PRP told/VBD Ms/NNP Sturgeon/NNP "It/NN is/VBZ disappointing/JJ that/IN you/PRP have/VBP contributed/VBN to/TO this/DT distortion/JJ by/IN saying/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ staggering/JJ that/IN I/PRP 'should/VBP encourage/VBP young/JJ people/NNS to/TO get/VB drunk'./NN
"That/NN is/VBZ completely/RB untrue./NN
