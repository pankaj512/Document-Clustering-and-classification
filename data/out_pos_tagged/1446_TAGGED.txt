Finnan/NNP says/VBZ Irish/JJ can/MD win/VB group/NN

Steve/NNP Finnan/NNP believes/VBZ the/DT Republic/NNP of/IN Ireland/NNP can/MD qualify/VB directly/RB for/IN the/DT World/NNP Cup/NNP finals./NN

After/IN Saturday's/NNP superb/NN display/NN in/IN the/DT draw/NN in/IN Paris/NNP Ireland/NNP face/NN minnows/NNS the/DT Faroe/NNP Islands/NNP in/IN Dublin/NNP on/IN Wednesday./NNP
The/DT versatile/NN Finnan/NNP who/WP starred/VBD against/IN the/DT French/JJ is/VBZ confident/JJ the/DT group/NN is/VBZ Ireland's/NNP for/IN the/DT taking./NN
"There/NN is/VBZ a/DT chance/NN for/IN us/PRP now/RB to/TO go/VB on/IN win/VBP our/PRP$ home/NN games/NNS and/CC why/WRB not/RB win/VB the/DT group/NN even/RB though/IN it's/NNS a/DT tough/JJ one"/NN said/VBD the/DT Liverpool/NNP player./NN
Switzerland/NNP Ireland/NNP France/NNP and/CC Israel/NNP are/VBP all/DT now/RB tied/VBN on/IN five/CD points/NNS from/IN three/CD matches/VBZ -/: although/IN the/DT Republic/NNP look/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT slight/JJ edge/NN after/IN claiming/VBG away/RB draws/VBZ in/IN Basel/NNP and/CC Paris./NNP
"In/NNP Basel/NNP we/PRP did/VBD not/RB play/VB great/JJ football/NN but/CC when/WRB you/PRP to/TO go/VB to/TO these/DT places/NNS the/DT other/JJ teams/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB the/DT majority/NN of/IN the/DT game./NN
"In/NNP Paris/NNP we/PRP looked/VBD good/JJ throughout/IN the/DT team/NN and/CC a/DT point/NN was/VBD the/DT least/JJS we/PRP deserved/VBD because/IN we/PRP had/VBD a/DT number/NN of/IN chances./NN

"Looking/VBG back/RB we/PRP had/VBD an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT three/CD points/NNS but/CC we/PRP are/VBP happy/JJ with/IN a/DT point/NN and/CC that/WDT will/MD give/VB us/PRP confidence/VBP going/VBG into/IN Wednesday's/NNP game./NN
"On/NN paper/NN we/PRP have/VBP got/VBN the/DT toughest/JJS matches/VBZ out/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN and/CC we/PRP have/VBP set/VBN standards/NNS for/IN ourselves./NN
"Automatic/JJ qualification/NN is/VBZ there./NN
It/PRP would/MD certainly/RB be/VB good/JJ to/TO avoid/VB a/DT play-off/JJ but/CC on/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN good/JJ results/NNS I/PRP don't/VBP see/NN why/WRB we/PRP can't/VBP win/VBP the/DT group."/NN Manager/NNP Brian/NNP Kerr/NNP was/VBD keen/JJ to/TO mention/VB the/DT contribution/NN of/IN Stephen/NNP Carr/NNP and/CC Finnan/NNP on/IN Ireland's/NNP right/JJ flank/NN at/IN the/DT Stade/NNP de/IN France./NNP
Finnan's/NNP normal/JJ position/NN is/VBZ right-back/JJ but/CC he/PRP looked/VBD assured/VBN in/IN a/DT more/JJR advanced/JJ position/NN against/IN the/DT French./NNP
"As/NN I/PRP play/VBP on/IN the/DT right/NN for/IN my/PRP$ club/NN and/CC being/VBG a/DT natural/JJ right-back/NN it/PRP was/VBD something/NN he/PRP (Kerr)/VB looked/VBD at/IN because/IN France/NNP play/VB strongly/RB down/RP the/DT left-hand/JJ side./NN
"So/NN I/PRP was/VBD happy/JJ to/TO play/VB and/CC Stephen/NNP Carr/NNP and/CC I/PRP enjoyed/VBD the/DT game/NN particularly/RB as/IN the/DT defence/NN and/CC midfield/NN held/VBN together/RB well/RB and/CC nullified/VBD their/PRP$ attacks."/NN
