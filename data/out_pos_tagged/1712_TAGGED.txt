"This/NN guy/NN is/VBZ an/DT absolute/JJ sporting/NN icon./NN
He's/NNP been/VBN at/IN the/DT top/NN for/IN so/RB long/JJ and/CC has/VBZ demonstrated/VBN so/RB many/JJ attributes/NNS that/IN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT tough/JJ contact/NN sport./NN
"Athletes/NN like/IN him/PRP -/: Ellery/NNP Hanley/NNP and/CC Martin/NNP Johnson/NNP -/: don't/NN come/VBN along/RP very/RB often./NN
