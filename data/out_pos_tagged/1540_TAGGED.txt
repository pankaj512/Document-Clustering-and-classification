Arsene/NNP Wenger/NNP has/VBZ pledged/VBN to/TO keep/VB faith/NN with/IN stand-in/JJ keeper/NN Manuel/NNP Almunia/NNP for/IN the/DT crunch/NN week/NN which/WDT could/MD define/VB Arsenal's/NNP season./NN

Almunia/NNP will/MD start/VB Tuesday's/NNP Champions/NNS League/NNP group/NN tie/NN against/IN Rosenborg/NNP and/CC is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO face/VB Chelsea/NNP on/IN Sunday./NNP
Wenger/NNP said/VBD "You/NN don't/NN think/VBP I/PRP would/MD take/VB out/RP one/CD goalkeeper/NN for/IN just/RB one/CD game/NN do/VBP you?/NN I/PRP don't/VBP do/VBP that./NN
"I/NN have/VBP to/TO give/VB him/PRP a/DT run/NN for/IN a/DT few/JJ games./NN
It's/NNP just/RB that/IN I/PRP don't/VBP want/VBP to/TO make/VB this/DT story/NN bigger/JJR than/IN it/PRP is."/NN Wenger/NNP insists/VBZ he/PRP has/VBZ complete/JJ faith/NN in/IN the/DT 27-year-old/JJ Spaniard/NNP who/WP was/VBD signed/VBN last/JJ summer/NN from/IN Celta/NNP Vigo/NNP as/RB back-up/JJ to/TO Jens/NNP Lehmann./NNP

"If/NN you/PRP look/VBP at/IN my/PRP$ career/NN you/PRP will/MD see/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP left/VBN many/JJ big/JJ players/NNS out/RP for/IN a/DT long/RB time./NN
I've/NNP done/VBD it/PRP with/IN Dennis/NNP Bergkamp/NNP Kanu/NNP everybody./NN
"It's/NN because/IN it's/NNS a/DT goalkeeper/NN that's/NNS all./NN
It's/VBG a/DT usual/JJ situation/NN for/IN me./NN
You/PRP put/VBP your/PRP$ best/JJS team/NN out/RP no/DT matter/NN who/WP it/PRP is./VBD
"For/NN me/PRP it/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT big/JJ mistake/NN at/IN Old/NNP Trafford/NNP and/CC I/PRP wasn't/VBP alarmed/VBN by/IN what/WP happened/VBD against/IN Birmingham/NNP either./NN
"It's/NN nothing/NN against/IN Lehmann./NNP
I/PRP think/VBP he's/NNS a/DT great/JJ keeper/NN as/IN is/VBZ Almunia./NNP
You/PRP can/MD only/RB play/VB one/CD of/IN them./NN
"These/NN people/NNS are/VBP not/RB robots/NNS -/: they/PRP have/VBP good/JJ periods/NNS and/CC less/RBR good/JJ periods./NN
Just/RB because/IN Lehmann/NNP doesn't/NN play/NN for/IN two/CD or/CC three/CD weeks/NNS or/CC longer/RB or/CC shorter/JJR it/PRP doesn't/NN mean/VB I've/NNP lost/VBD faith/NN in/IN him."/NN

But/CC former/JJ Arsenal/NN keeper/NN David/NNP Seaman/NNP believes/VBZ Lehmann/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN harshly/RB treated./NN
Seaman/NNP told/VBD the/DT Daily/NNP Mail/NNP "Jens/NN is/VBZ a/DT fantastic/JJ keeper./NN
He/PRP deserves/VBZ another/DT chance./NN
"He/NN has/VBZ made/VBN a/DT few/JJ mistakes/NNS but/CC on/IN form/NN he/PRP deserves/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT first-team/JJ choice."/NN With/IN Arsenal/NN hit/VBN by/IN injuries/NNS and/CC suspension/NN inexperienced/JJ midfield/NN pair/NN of/IN Mathieu/NNP Flamini/NNP and/CC Cesc/NNP Fabregas/NNP will/MD line/VB up/RP against/IN Rosenborg/NNP but/CC Wenger/NNP is/VBZ confident/JJ they/PRP will/MD prove/VB more/JJR than/IN capable./NN
"It/NN puts/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN pressure/NN on/IN them/PRP but/CC it's/VBZ a/DT good/JJ learning/NN process"/NN said/VBD Wenger./NNP
"I'm/NN not/RB worried/VBD as/IN they/PRP are/VBP both/DT mentally/RB strong/JJ and/CC will/MD put/VB in/IN the/DT needed/VBN workrate."/NN

The/DT Gunners/NNS go/VBP into/IN the/DT game/NN boosted/VBN by/IN the/DT news/NN that/DT defender/NN Sol/NNP Campbell/NNP is/VBZ on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN signing/VBG a/DT new/JJ deal/NN with/IN the/DT club./NN
And/CC the/DT 30-year-old/JJ whose/WP$ current/JJ contract/NN runs/VBZ out/RP in/IN the/DT summer/NN has/VBZ made/VBN it/PRP clear/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ determined/VBN to/TO achieve/VB Champions/NNS League/NNP success/NN with/IN Arsenal./NNP
Campbell/NNP said/VBD "It/NN means/VBZ a/DT lot/NN to/TO me/PRP to/TO go/VB through/IN it's/NNS everything./NN
We/PRP want/VBP to/TO carry/VB on/RP in/IN this/DT competition./NN
"That's/NN where/WRB the/DT best/JJS teams/NNS in/IN Europe/NNP are./NN
To/TO be/VB in/IN there/EX playing/VBG against/IN these/DT guys/NNS and/CC trying/VBG to/TO win/VB the/DT trophy/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ thing/NN in/IN my/PRP$ mind."/NN

Meanwhile/RB Thierry/NNP Henry/NNP believes/VBZ he/PRP will/MD be/VB blamed/VBN if/IN Arsenal/NN fail/NN to/TO qualify/VB for/IN the/DT next/JJ stage/NN of/IN the/DT Champions/NNS League./NNP
Henry/NNP will/MD captain/VB the/DT side/NN in/IN place/NN of/IN the/DT suspended/VBN Patrick/NNP Vieira/NNP as/IN the/DT Gunners/NNS seek/VBP the/DT required/JJ victory/NN over/IN Rosenborg./NNP
And/CC the/DT striker/NN said/VBD "If/NN we/PRP don't/VBP win/NN and/CC we/PRP go/VBP out/IN of/IN the/DT competition/NN like/IN it/PRP or/CC not/RB it's/NNS going/VBG to/TO be/VB my/PRP$ fault./NN
That's/VBG the/DT way/NN it/PRP is./VBD
"If/NN the/DT team/NN don't/NN win/NN I/PRP know/VBP I/PRP will/MD be/VB criticised/VBN no/DT matter/NN how/WRB I/PRP play."/VBP
