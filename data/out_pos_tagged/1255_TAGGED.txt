"I/NN think/VBP that/IN Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP wants/VBZ to/TO be/VB part/NN of/IN the/DT successful/JJ Labour/NNP government/NN which/WDT delivers/VBZ in/IN the/DT third/JJ term/NN for/IN the/DT priorities/NNS of/IN the/DT people/NNS and/CC sees/VBZ off/RP a/DT Conservative/JJ Party/NNP that/WDT will/MD take/VB Britain/NNP backwards"/NN Mr/NNP Balls/NNS told/VBD Today./NNP
