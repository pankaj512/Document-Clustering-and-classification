Costin/NNP aims/VBZ for/IN comeback/NN in/IN 2006/CD

Jamie/NNP Costin/NNP should/MD be/VB paralysed./NN

He/PRP says/VBZ so/IN himself/PRP in/IN a/DT matter-of-fact/JJ way/NN as/IN he/PRP recalls/VBZ the/DT car/NN accident/NN which/WDT occurred/VBD nine/CD days/NNS before/IN he/PRP was/VBD scheduled/VBN to/TO step/VB out/RP into/IN the/DT Olympic/NNP Stadium/NNP in/IN Athens/NNP for/IN the/DT 50K/CD Walk./NNP
There/EX is/VBZ an/DT ironic/JJ chuckle/NN as/IN he/PRP talks/VBZ of/IN his/PRP$ immediate/JJ thoughts/NNS after/IN a/DT lorry/NN driving/VBG on/IN the/DT wrong/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT road/NN had/VBD ploughed/VBN into/IN his/PRP$ rental/JJ car./NN
"I/NN was/VBD in/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN pain/NN and/CC I/PRP guessed/VBD that/IN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ toes/NNS was/VBD broken"/NN says/VBZ the/DT Waterford/NNP man./NN
"But/NN I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG maybe/RB with/IN a/DT cortisone/NN injection/NN you/PRP never/RB know./VBP
"In/NN my/PRP$ back/RB it/PRP felt/VBD as/IN though/IN all/PDT the/DT muscles/NNS had/VBD been/VBN ripped/VBN off/RP my/PRP$ pelvis/NNS but/CC I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG maybe/RB we/PRP could/MD do/VB something/NN with/IN laser/NN therapy/NN and/CC ultra/NN sound/NN and/CC hopefully/RB I'd/NNP be/VBP able/JJ to/TO race."/VB It/PRP took/VBD over/RP 10/CD hours/NNS before/IN Jamie/NNP knew/VBD with/IN certainty/NN that/IN he/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB competing/VBG in/IN his/PRP$ second/JJ Olympics./NNP
"My/NN back/RB had/VBD been/VBN broken/VBN in/IN two/CD places/NNS and/CC with/IN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ vertebrae/NN the/DT bottom/NN part/NN had/VBD exploded/VBN so/RB I'm/NNP fierce/JJ lucky/JJ not/RB be/VB paralysed./NN
"I'd/NN fractured/JJ my/PRP$ big/JJ toe/NN as/IN well/RB which/WDT was/VBD on/IN the/DT brake."/NN Jamie/NNP didn't/NN finally/RB arrive/VB at/IN hospital/NN in/IN Athens/NNP until/IN some/DT nine/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN hours/NNS after/IN the/DT accident./NN

"For/NN the/DT first/JJ nine/CD hours/NNS I/PRP had/VBD no/DT pain/NN killers/NNS which/WDT was/VBD ridiculous/JJ in/IN 35/CD degrees/NNS heat./NN
"But/NN once/IN I/PRP got/VBD the/DT scans/NNS and/CC saw/VBD them/PRP it/PRP was/VBD a/DT case/NN of/IN moving/VBG on/IN and/CC thinking'OK/NN I've/NNP got/VBD a/DT different/JJ set/NN of/IN circumstances/NNS now'."/NN Within/IN three/CD days/NNS he/PRP was/VBD arriving/VBG back/RB in/IN Ireland/NNP by/IN air/NN ambulance./NN
Doctors/NNS in/IN Athens/NNP had/VBD wanted/VBN to/TO operate/VB on/IN Jamie's/NNP back/RB immediately/RB but/CC he/PRP insisted/VBD on/IN delaying/VBG any/DT surgery/NN until/IN he/PRP arrived/VBD back/RB home/NN -/: something/NN he/PRP is/VBZ now/RB very/RB relieved/VBN about./NN
"The/NN Greek/JJ doctors/NNS were/VBD going/VBG to/TO put/VB three/CD or/CC four/CD inch/NN titanium/NN rods/NNS either/DT side/NN of/IN my/PRP$ spinal/JJ cord/NN up/IN through/IN my/PRP$ vertebrae./NN
"That/NN would/MD have/VB fused/VBN all/DT my/PRP$ lower/RBR back/RB and/CC I/PRP would/MD never/RB have/VB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO race/VB again./NN
They/PRP were/VBD really/RB putting/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN pressure/NN on/IN me/PRP to/TO agree/VB to/TO the/DT surgery./NN
"But/NN when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD to/TO the/DT Mater/NN in/IN Dublin/NNP they/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ for/IN it/PRP to/TO heal/VB totally/RB naturally/RB which/WDT is/VBZ giving/VBG me/PRP the/DT chance/NN to/TO get/VB back/RB into/IN competition/NN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ to/TO me./VB
The/DT people/NNS at/IN the/DT Mater/NN have/VBP been/VBN absolutely/RB fantastic."/NN Jamie/NNP had/VBD to/TO wear/VB a/DT body/NN cast/NN for/IN three/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN months/NNS after/IN the/DT accident/NN and/CC spent/VBD most/JJS of/IN that/DT time/NN flat/JJ on/IN his/PRP$ back./NN

He/PRP then/RB progressed/VBD to/TO crutches/NNS for/IN six/CD weeks/NNS until/IN he/PRP was/VBD finally/RB able/JJ to/TO walk/VB unaided/VBN on/IN 10/CD January./NNP
"Walking/VBG without/IN the/DT crutches/NNS seemed/VBD like/IN something/NN finally/RB really/RB measurable/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ recovery."/NN Physio/NNP sessions/NNS with/IN Johnston/NNP McEvoy/NNP in/IN Limerick/NNP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT vital/JJ part/NN of/IN his/PRP$ recovery./NN
"Johnston/NN uses/VBZ an/DT advanced/JJ type/NN of/IN acupuncture/NN and/CC it's/NNS very/RB effective./VBP
"Needles/NN get/NN put/VB right/JJ close/NN up/RP to/TO my/PRP$ spine./NN
A/DT two/CD and/CC a/DT half/JJ inch/NN needle/NN went/VBD in/IN yesterday/NN and/CC I'm/NNP fairly/RB incapacitated/VBD today/NN as/IN a/DT result."/NN Jamie/NNP has/VBZ also/RB travelled/VBN to/TO receive/VB treatment/NN at/IN the/DT Polish/JJ training/NN centre/NN in/IN Spala/NNP where/WRB he/PRP has/VBZ trained/VBN with/IN triple/JJ Olympic/NNP champion/NN Robert/NNP Korzeniowski/NNP over/IN the/DT past/JJ five/CD years./NN
"I/NN was/VBD there/RB for/IN over/IN a/DT fortnight/NN earlier/RBR this/DT month/NN and/CC underwent/VBD a/DT fair/JJ extreme/JJ treatment/NN called/VBD cryotherapy./NN
"Basically/RB there's/VBZ a/DT small/JJ room/NN which/WDT is/VBZ cooled/VBN by/IN liquid/JJ nitrogen/NN to/TO minus/CC 160/CD degrees/NNS centigrade/NN and/CC it/PRP promotes/VBZ deep/JJ healing."/NN

Jamie/NNP heads/VBZ to/TO Poland/NNP again/RB on/IN Sunday/NNP where/WRB he/PRP will/MD be/VB having/VBG daily/JJ cryotherapy/NN in/IN addition/NN to/TO twice-daily/JJ physio/NN sessions/NNS and/CC pool-work./JJ
All/PDT these/DT sessions/NNS are/VBP small/JJ steps/NNS on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO what/WP Jamie/NNP hopes/VBZ will/MD be/VB a/DT return/NN to/TO racing/VBG in/IN 2006./CD
"It's/NN all/DT about/IN trying/VBG to/TO get/VB mobility/NN in/IN my/PRP$ back./NN
Lying/VBG down/RP for/IN three/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN months/NNS didn't/NN really/RB help/VB with/IN the/DT strength./NN
"There's/NN a/DT lot/NN of/IN work/NN involved/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ recovery./NN
I'm/NNP doing/VBG about/IN six/CD hours/NNS a/DT day/NN between/IN physio/NN and/CC pool/NN work./NN
"I'm/NN also/RB going/VBG to/TO the/DT gym/NN to/TO lift/VB very/RB light/JJ weights/NNS to/TO try/VB and/CC build/VB up/RP my/PRP$ muscles./NN
I'm/NNP fairly/RB full/JJ on/IN with/IN everything/NN I/PRP do./VBP
"I'd/NN hope/VBP to/TO be/VB training/NN regularly/RB by/IN March./NNP
But/CC training/NN is/VBZ just/RB part/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN getting/VBG back./NN
"At/NN the/DT moment/NN every/DT time/NN I/PRP go/VBP and/CC do/VB a/DT big/JJ bit/NN of/IN movement/NN my/PRP$ whole/JJ pelvic/JJ area/NN all/DT down/RB my/PRP$ lower/RBR back/RB just/RB tightens/NNS up./NN
"It's/NN a/DT case/NN of/IN waiting/VBG and/CC seeing/VBG how/WRB it/PRP reacts./NN
Hopefully/RB after/IN four/CD or/CC five/CD months/NNS my/PRP$ back/JJ won't/NN tighten/VB up/RP as/IN much."/NN
