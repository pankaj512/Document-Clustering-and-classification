Blair/NNP ready/JJ to/TO call/VB election/NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP seems/VBZ certain/JJ to/TO end/VB weeks/NNS of/IN phoney/JJ war/NN on/IN Monday/NNP and/CC announce/VB there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT general/JJ election/NN on/IN 5/CD May./NNP

The/DT date/NN has/VBZ been/VBN pencilled/VBN into/IN the/DT diaries/NNS of/IN politicians/NNS and/CC political/JJ journalists/NNS for/IN many/JJ months/NNS and/CC despite/IN occasional/JJ panics/NNS that/IN the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT verge/NN of/IN calling/VBG a/DT snap/NN poll/NN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB shifted./NN
Over/IN the/DT weeks/NNS there/RB have/VBP been/VBN any/DT number/NN of/IN signs/NNS that/IN 050505/CD was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB the/DT day/NN Mr/NNP Blair/NNP would/MD go/VB for/IN an/DT historic/JJ third/JJ term./NN
And/CC the/DT calling/NN of/IN a/DT special/JJ political/JJ cabinet/NN meeting/NN has/VBZ only/RB added/VBN to/TO the/DT belief/NN that/IN the/DT announcement/NN is/VBZ imminent./NN
The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN and/CC his/PRP$ campaign/NN boss/NN Alan/NNP Milburn/NNP have/VBP already/RB insisted/VBN the/DT election/NN will/MD be/VB fought/VBN on/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC what/WP they/PRP claim/VBP is/VBZ a/DT stark/JJ choice/NN between/IN Labour's/NNP stability/NN and/CC investment/NN against/IN Tory/NNP cuts/NNS and/CC boom/NN and/CC bust./NN

And/CC Chancellor/NNP Gordon/NNP Brown/NNP has/VBZ stepped/VBN into/IN the/DT front/JJ line/NN of/IN the/DT campaign/NN -/: to/TO the/DT relief/NN of/IN many/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ supporters/NNS in/IN Westminster/NNP -/: to/TO underline/VB that/IN economic/JJ message./NN
And/CC it/PRP is/VBZ certain/JJ one/CD of/IN the/DT big/JJ arguments/NNS at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN the/DT election/NN battle/NN will/MD be/VB around/IN the/DT big/JJ parties'/NN tax/NN and/CC spend/VB policies./NN

During/IN the/DT phoney/JJ campaign/NN Labour/NNP got/VBD into/IN trouble/NN over/IN its/PRP$ central/JJ claim/NN that/IN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP was/VBD planning/NN Â£35/CD bn/NN cuts/NNS in/IN public/JJ services./NN
The/DT prime/JJ minister/NN found/VBD himself/PRP struggling/VBG to/TO explain/VB how/WRB a/DT smaller/JJR slower/JJR increase/NN in/IN spending/NN planned/VBN by/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS compared/VBD to/TO Labour's/NNP plans/VBZ was/VBD a/DT cut./NN
And/CC it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN the/DT Labour/NNP campaign/NN -/: which/WDT was/VBD already/RB being/VBG criticised/VBN for/IN being/VBG thrown/VBN into/IN defensive/JJ mode/NN by/IN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP on/IN issues/NNS such/JJ as/IN immigration/NN and/CC health/NN -/: was/VBD on/IN the/DT rocks./NN
Then/RB deputy/NN Conservative/JJ Chairman/NNP Howard/NNP Flight/NNP was/VBD reported/VBN to/TO have/VB suggested/VBN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP was/VBD secretly/RB planning/NN even/RB bigger/JJR "cuts"./NN

He/PRP was/VBD sacked/VBN for/IN his/PRP$ gaffe/NN but/CC the/DT damage/NN had/VBD been/VBN done/VBN and/CC the/DT faltering/VBG Labour/NNP campaign/NN was/VBD back/RB on/IN track./NN
A/DT second/JJ central/JJ argument/NN will/MD be/VB over/IN taxation/NN with/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS claiming/VBG the/DT Chancellor/NNP has/VBZ to/TO fill/VB a/DT black/JJ hole/NN at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN his/PRP$ finances/NNS and/CC will/MD be/VB forced/VBN to/TO raise/VB taxes/NNS if/IN Labour/NNP wins/VBZ again./NN
Mr/NNP Brown/NNP slaps/VBZ that/IN aside/RB claiming/VBG his/PRP$ forecasts/NNS are/VBP accurate/JJ and/CC that/IN previous/JJ claims/NNS of/IN looming/VBG economic/JJ disaster/NN have/VBP proved/VBN inaccurate./NN
As/IN usual/JJ the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS will/MD have/VB to/TO fight/VB to/TO get/VB their/PRP$ voice/NN heard/VBN over/IN the/DT sounds/NNS of/IN battle/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD big/JJ parties./NN
But/CC leader/NN Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP believes/VBZ he/PRP has/VBZ set/VBN out/RP a/DT distinctive/JJ manifesto/NN with/IN plans/NNS for/IN a/DT tax/NN rise/NN for/IN the/DT wealthiest/JJS to/TO finance/VB extra/JJ spending/NN and/CC the/DT abolition/NN of/IN the/DT council/NN tax/NN in/IN favour/NN of/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax./NN
Other/JJ issues/NNS are/VBP certain/JJ to/TO play/VB a/DT part/NN -/: immigration/NN and/CC asylum/VB the/DT war/NN on/IN Iraq/NNP law/NN and/CC order/NN and/CC education/NN for/IN example./NN
But/CC as/IN ever/RB it/PRP will/MD be/VB the/DT economy/NN that/WDT will/MD almost/RB certainly/RB decide/VB the/DT outcome./NN
And/CC whatever/WDT that/DT outcome/NN 2005/CD is/VBZ set/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT far/RB more/RBR lively/JJ even/RB bitter/JJ campaign/NN than/IN 2001's/CD non-event./JJ
