Spurs/VBZ boss/NN Martin/NNP Jol/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ team/NN were/VBD "robbed"/NN at/IN Manchester/NNP United/NNP after/IN Pedro/NNP Mendes'/NNP shot/NN clearly/RB crossed/VBD the/DT line/NN but/CC was/VBD not/RB given./NN

"The/NN referee/NN is/VBZ already/RB wearing/VBG an/DT earpiece/NN so/RB why/WRB can't/NN we/PRP just/RB stop/VBP the/DT game/NN and/CC get/VB the/DT decision/NN right"/NN said/VBD Jol/NNP after/IN the/DT 0-0/JJ draw./NN
"But/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN it's/NNS so/RB obvious/JJ that/IN Pedro's/NNP shot/NN was/VBD over/IN the/DT line/NN it's/NNS incredible./NN
"We/NN feel/VBP robbed/VBN but/CC it's/NNS difficult/JJ for/IN the/DT linesman/NN and/CC referee/NN to/TO see/VB it."/NN Mendes/NNP shot/NN from/IN 50/CD yards/NNS and/CC United/NNP goalkeeper/NN Roy/NNP Carroll/NNP spilled/VBD the/DT ball/NN into/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ net/NN before/IN hooking/VBG it/PRP clear./NN
Jol/NNP added/VBD "We/NN are/VBP not/RB talking/VBG about/IN the/DT ball/NN being/VBG a/DT couple/NN of/IN centimetres/NNS or/CC an/DT inch/NN or/CC two/CD over/IN the/DT line/NN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT metre/NN inside/IN the/DT goal./NN
"What/NN really/RB annoys/VBZ me/PRP is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP are/VBP here/RB in/IN 2005/CD watching/VBG something/NN on/IN a/DT TV/NN monitor/NN within/IN two/CD seconds/NNS of/IN the/DT incident/NN occurring/VBG and/CC the/DT referee/NN isn't/NN told/VBD about/IN it./NN

"We/NN didn't/NN play/NN particularly/RB well/RB but/CC I/PRP am/VBP pleased/JJ -/: even/RB now/RB -/: with/IN a/DT point/NN although/IN we/PRP should/MD have/VB had/VBN three."/NN Mendes/NNP could/MD not/RB believe/VB the/DT 'goal'/NN was/VBD not/RB given/VBN after/IN seeing/VBG a/DT replay./NN
He/PRP said/VBD "My/NN reaction/NN on/IN the/DT pitch/NN was/VBD to/TO celebrate./VB
"It/NN was/VBD a/DT very/RB nice/JJ goal/NN it/PRP was/VBD clearly/RB over/IN the/DT line/NN -/: I've/NNP never/RB seen/VBD one/CD so/RB over/IN the/DT line/NN and/CC not/RB given/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ career./NN
"It's/NN really/RB really/RB over./NN
What/WP can/MD you/PRP do/VB but/CC laugh/NN about/IN it?/NN It's/NNP a/DT nice/JJ goal/NN and/CC one/CD to/TO keep/VB in/IN my/PRP$ memory/NN even/RB though/IN it/PRP didn't/NN count./NN
"It's/NN not/RB every/DT game/NN you/PRP score/VBP from/IN the/DT halfway/NN line."/NN Manchester/NNP United/NNP manager/NN Sir/NNP Alex/NNP Ferguson/NNP sympathised/VBD with/IN Tottenham/NNP and/CC said/VBD the/DT incident/NN highlighted/VBD the/DT need/NN for/IN video/NN technology./NN
"I/NN think/VBP it/PRP hammers/VBZ home/NN what/WP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS have/VBP been/VBN asking/VBG for/IN and/CC that's/NNS that/DT technology/NN should/MD play/VB a/DT part/NN in/IN the/DT game"/NN Ferguson/NNP told/VBD MUTV./NNP
"What/NN I/PRP was/VBD against/IN originally/RB was/VBD the/DT time/NN factor/NN in/IN video/NN replays./NN
"But/NN I/PRP read/VBP an/DT article/NN the/DT other/JJ day/NN which/WDT suggested/VBD that/IN if/IN a/DT referee/NN can't/NN make/VBP up/RP his/PRP$ mind/NN after/IN 30/CD seconds/NNS of/IN watching/VBG a/DT video/NN replay/NN then/RB the/DT game/NN should/MD carry/VB on./NN

"Thirty/NN seconds/NNS is/VBZ about/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN time/NN it/PRP takes/VBZ to/TO organise/VB a/DT free-kick/JJ or/CC take/VB a/DT corner/NN or/CC a/DT goal-kick./JJ
So/RB you/PRP wouldn't/VBP be/VB wasting/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN time./NN
"I/NN think/VBP you/PRP could/MD start/VB off/RP by/IN using/VBG it/PRP for/IN goal-line/JJ decisions./NN
I/PRP think/VBP that/WDT would/MD be/VB an/DT opening/NN into/IN a/DT new/JJ area/NN of/IN football."/NN Arsenal/NN boss/NN Arsene/NNP Wenger/NNP also/RB used/VBD the/DT incident/NN to/TO highlight/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN video/NN technology./NN
"When/NN the/DT whole/JJ world/NN apart/RB from/IN the/DT referee/NN has/VBZ seen/VBN there/EX should/MD be/VB a/DT goal/NN at/IN Old/NNP Trafford/NNP that/WDT just/RB reinforces/VBZ what/WP I/PRP feel/VBP -/: there/EX should/MD be/VB video/NN evidence"/NN said/VBD Wenger./NNP
"It's/NN a/DT great/JJ example/NN of/IN where/WRB the/DT referee/NN could/MD have/VB asked/VBN to/TO see/VB a/DT replay/NN and/CC would/MD have/VB seen/VBN in/IN five/CD seconds/NNS that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT goal."/NN
