Parliament's/NNP record/NN of/IN scandal/NN

In/IN a/DT locked/JJ room/NN at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP there/EX is/VBZ a/DT hive/NN of/IN scandal./NN

Sex/NN betrayal/JJ and/CC custody/NN of/IN children/NNS are/VBP all/DT there/RB in/IN this/DT affair/NN but/CC this/DT time/NN it/PRP has/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT recent/JJ troubles/NNS of/IN David/NNP Blunkett/NNP or/CC Boris/NNP Johnson./NNP

Few/JJ realise/NN that/IN Westminster/NNP in/IN effect/NN has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ divorce/NN den./NN
For/IN sprinkled/VBN among/IN 12/CD floors/NNS of/IN archives/NNS are/VBP blow-by-blow/JJ accounts/NNS of/IN marital/JJ break-ups/NNS -/: and/CC now/RB you/PRP can/MD search/VB what's/NNS there/RB online./NN
Until/IN 1857/CD the/DT only/JJ way/NN in/IN England/NNP to/TO get/VB a/DT full/JJ divorce/NN which/WDT allowed/VBD re-marriage/NN was/VBD to/TO obtain/VB an/DT Act/NNP of/IN Parliament/NNP by/IN proving/VBG adultery/NN or/CC life-threatening/JJ cruelty./NN
The/DT legacy/NN is/VBZ pages/NNS of/IN testimonies/NNS used/VBN in/IN the/DT hearings/NNS dating/VBG back/RB to/TO 1670/CD all/DT recorded/VBN among/IN the/DT 325000/CD items/NNS which/WDT fill/VBP the/DT 12/CD floors/NNS of/IN the/DT parliamentary/JJ archives/NNS in/IN Parliament's/NNP Victoria/NNP Tower./NNP
Most/JJS people/NNS researching/VBG their/PRP$ family/NN history/NN want/VBP to/TO discover/VB some/DT tale/NN of/IN illicit/JJ love./NN
This/DT gives/VBZ them/PRP the/DT chance./NN

Divorce/NN by/IN Parliament/NNP was/VBD an/DT expensive/JJ process/NN open/JJ really/RB only/RB to/TO the/DT rich/JJ but/CC the/DT records/NNS also/RB include/VBP the/DT testimony/NN of/IN maids/NNS butlers/NNS and/CC coachmen/NNS about/IN their/PRP$ masters/NNS and/CC mistresses./NN
Among/IN the/DT records/NNS is/VBZ the/DT story/NN of/IN Jane/NNP Campbell/NNP the/DT first/JJ woman/NN ever/RB to/TO divorce/VB her/PRP$ husband./NN
That/DT happened/VBD in/IN 1801/CD after/IN she/PRP had/VBD discovered/VBN her/PRP$ husband/NN Edward/NNP Addison/NNP had/VBD committed/VBN adultery/NN with/IN her/PRP$ sister/NN Jessy./NNP

A/DT transcript/NN of/IN evidence/NN from/IN Jessy's/NNP maid/NN Amelia/NNP Laugher/NNP shows/VBZ her/PRP$ telling/VBG how/WRB Addison/NNP frequently/RB passed/VBN by/IN her/PRP on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO the/DT room/NN where/WRB she/PRP had/VBD just/RB put/VB her/PRP$ mistress/JJ naked/JJ to/TO bed./VB
It/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT killer/NN blow/NN to/TO Addison's/NNP case/NN -/: he/PRP had/VBD already/RB fled/VBN abroad/RB rather/RB than/IN pay/VB the/DT Â£5000/CD damages/NNS ordered/VBN by/IN a/DT civil/JJ court./NN
As/RB well/RB as/IN making/VBG divorce/NN history/NN Jane/NNP Campbell/NNP won/VBD custody/NN of/IN her/PRP$ children/NNS -/: unusual/JJ for/IN a/DT woman/NN at/IN the/DT time./NN
But/CC divorces/NNS are/VBP by/IN no/DT means/NNS the/DT only/JJ documents/NNS in/IN the/DT archives/NNS which/WDT hold/VBP personal/JJ details/NNS of/IN people/NNS often/RB far/RB removed/VBN from/IN politics/NNS and/CC Parliament./NNP

There/EX are/VBP the/DT protestation/NN returns/NNS from/IN 1642/CD -/: lists/NNS of/IN the/DT Protestants/NNPS who/WP pledged/VBD to/TO "maintain/VB the/DT true/JJ reformed/VBN Protestant/JJ religion"./NN
There/EX are/VBP details/NNS of/IN foreign/JJ nationals/NNS made/VBD British/JJ citizens/NNS by/IN act/NN of/IN Parliament/NNP including/VBG composer/NN George/NNP Frideric/NNP Handel/NNP in/IN 1727./CD
And/CC the/DT mass/NN of/IN private/JJ bills/NNS which/WDT for/IN example/NN authorise/NN the/DT building/NN of/IN railways/NNS and/CC roads/NNS contain/VBP both/DT the/DT names/NNS and/CC addresses/NNS of/IN those/DT involved/VBN and/CC testimonies/NNS giving/VBG people/NNS a/DT unique/JJ perspective/NN on/IN how/WRB their/PRP$ ancestors/NNS opposed/VBD them./NN

Tax/NN bills/NNS may/MD be/VB an/DT extra/JJ source/NN for/IN pedigree/NN hunters/NNS -/: the/DT longest/JJS stretches/NNS for/IN about/IN 300m/CD and/CC is/VBZ longer/RBR than/IN the/DT Palace/NNP of/IN Westminster/NNP itself/PRP listing/VBP the/DT names/NNS of/IN appointed/VBN tax/NN collectors./NN
This/DT wealth/NN of/IN material/NN has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN open/JJ to/TO the/DT public/NN at/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords/NNPS Record/NNP Office/NNP with/IN visitors/NNS able/JJ to/TO phone/VB ahead/RB when/WRB they/PRP want/VBP to/TO view/VB particular/JJ items/NNS in/IN the/DT search/NN room./NN
But/CC now/RB five/CD years/NNS of/IN work/NN has/VBZ produced/VBN an/DT online/NN catalogue./NN
David/NNP Prior/RB assistant/NN clerk/NN of/IN the/DT archives/NNS says/VBZ the/DT catalogue/NN opens/VBZ up/RP new/JJ possibilities/NNS for/IN research./NN
"Before/NN you/PRP just/RB could/MD not/RB do/VB it/PRP you/PRP faced/VBD trawling/VBG through/IN pages/NNS and/CC pages/NNS of/IN printed/VBN material"/NN he/PRP says./VB
Mr/NNP Prior/RB sees/VBZ the/DT changes/NNS as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT wider/JJR revolution/NN in/IN archives/NNS generally./NN
"The/NN archive/NN profession/NN may/MD look/VB fairly/RB staid/JJ but/CC is/VBZ in/IN an/DT enormous/JJ period/NN of/IN change/NN mainly/RB motivated/VBN by/IN the/DT potential/NN of/IN IT/PRP which/WDT is/VBZ opening/VBG up/RP all/DT sorts/NNS of/IN vistas/NNS for/IN us"/NN he/PRP says./VB

The/DT archives/NNS do/VBP of/IN course/NN hold/NN records/NNS of/IN high/JJ (and/NN low)/NN politics/NNS too/RB for/IN both/DT Houses/NNS of/IN Parliament/NNP including/VBG copies/NNS of/IN all/DT acts/NNS passed/VBN since/IN 1497/CD -/: the/DT oldest/JJS dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT employment/NN of/IN workers/NNS in/IN the/DT woollen/NN industry/NN in/IN Norfolk./NNP
Records/NNS for/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS only/RB date/NN back/RB to/TO 1834/CD -/: anything/NN earlier/RBR was/VBD wiped/VBN out/RP by/IN the/DT fire/NN which/WDT destroyed/VBD most/JJS of/IN the/DT Parliament/NNP buildings/NNS in/IN 1834./CD

But/CC that/WDT still/RB leaves/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ documents/NNS of/IN UK/NNP political/JJ history/NN -/: parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Bill/NNP of/IN Rights/NNPS from/IN 1689/CD the/DT death/NN warrant/NN for/IN Charles/NNP I/PRP the/DT private/JJ papers/NNS and/CC diaries/NNS of/IN major/JJ politicians/NNS such/JJ as/IN David/NNP Lloyd/NNP George/NNP and/CC Andrew/NNP Bonar/NNP Law./NNP
There/EX is/VBZ also/RB the/DT 1606/CD act/NN establishing/VBG 5/CD November/NNP as/IN a/DT thanksgiving/JJ day/NN -/: the/DT year/NN after/IN the/DT Gunpowder/NNP Plot./NNP
That/DT document/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO feature/VB in/IN the/DT exhibition/NN the/DT archives/NNS will/MD put/VB on/IN next/JJ year/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN events/NNS across/IN London/NNP to/TO mark/VB the/DT 400th/JJ anniversary/NN of/IN Guy/NNP Fawkes'/NNP conspiracy./NN
As/IN Mr/NNP Prior/RB remarks/VBZ as/IN we/PRP walk/VBP by/IN shelf/NN after/IN shelf/NN of/IN vellum/NN (parchment/NN made/VBN from/IN goat's/NNS skin)/NN "All/NN human/JJ life/NN is/VBZ here."/NN
