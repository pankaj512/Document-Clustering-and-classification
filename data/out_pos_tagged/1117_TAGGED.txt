He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP accepted/VBD the/DT difficult/JJ balance/NN between/IN the/DT nation's/NNS security/NN and/CC human/JJ rights/NNS but/CC questioned/VBD why/WRB the/DT home/NN office/NN had/VBD made/VBN "no/NN contingency/NN plans/NNS for/IN the/DT present/JJ circumstances"./NN

"These/NN detainees/NNS should/MD be/VB prosecuted/VBN and/CC tried./NN
Simply/RB renewing/VBG the/DT present/JJ deeply/RB unsatisfactory/NN legislation/NN is/VBZ not/RB an/DT option."/NN Shadow/NNP home/NN secretary/NN David/NNP Davis/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD not/RB possible/JJ to/TO overstate/VB the/DT importance/NN of/IN the/DT judgment/NN and/CC urged/VBD the/DT government/NN to/TO move/VB as/RB fast/RB as/IN "competently/RB possible"/NN to/TO sort/VB the/DT problem/NN out/RP in/IN the/DT interests/NNS of/IN natural/JJ justice./NN
