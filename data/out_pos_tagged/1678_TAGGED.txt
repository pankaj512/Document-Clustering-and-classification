Williams/NNP stays/VBZ on/IN despite/IN dispute/NN

Matt/NNP Williams/NNP insists/VBZ he/PRP has/VBZ no/DT thoughts/NNS of/IN quitting/VBG as/IN national/JJ coach/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT power/NN struggle/NN currently/RB gripping/JJ Scottish/JJ rugby./NN

The/DT chairman/NN chief/NN executive/NN and/CC three/CD non-executive/JJ directors/NNS all/DT departed/VBD in/IN a/DT row/NN over/IN the/DT game's/NNS future/JJ direction./NN
But/CC Williams/NNP said/VBD "I/NN want/VBP to/TO make/VB it/PRP clear/JJ that/IN I'm/NNP committed/VBD totally/RB to/TO Scottish/JJ rugby./NN
"I've/NN brought/VBD my/PRP$ family/NN here/RB and/CC we've/NN immersed/VBD ourselves/PRP in/IN Scottish/JJ life./NN
There's/VBG no/DT way/NN that/IN I'm/NNP walking/VBG away."/NN However/RB he/PRP attempted/VBD to/TO steer/VB clear/JJ of/IN taking/VBG sides/NNS in/IN the/DT dispute./JJ
"I'd/NN like/VB to/TO stress/VB that/IN the/DT national/JJ team/NN is/VBZ separate/JJ to/TO the/DT political/JJ situation"/NN he/PRP said./VB

"When/NN you/PRP come/VBP to/TO an/DT undertaking/NN like/IN this/DT and/CC you/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO make/VB a/DT difference/NN then/RB there/EX are/VBP always/RB people/NNS who/WP will/MD begrudge/VB you/PRP who/WP are/VBP jealous/JJ and/CC want/VBP to/TO try/VB to/TO drag/VB you/PRP down./VBP
"When/NN you/PRP have/VBP that/WDT situation/NN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO have/VB the/DT courage/NN of/IN your/PRP$ convictions/NNS to/TO see/VB it/PRP through./NN
"There/NN was/VBD some/DT very/RB unhelpful/JJ and/CC uninformed/JJ comment/NN that/IN the/DT national/JJ team/NN had/VBD received/VBN a/DT massive/JJ increase/NN in/IN budget/NN at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN Scottish/JJ rugby/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ simply/RB not/RB the/DT case./NN
"Like/NN all/DT good/JJ coaches/NNS you/PRP go/VBP and/CC ask/VB for/IN an/DT increase./NN
But/CC we/PRP were/VBD told/VBD in/IN no/DT uncertain/JJ terms/NNS that/IN the/DT financial/JJ situation/NN did/VBD not/RB allow/VB that./NN
"The/NN idea/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP lighting/VBG cigars/NNS with/IN Â£20/CD notes/NNS while/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN Scottish/JJ rugby/NN flounders/NNS is/VBZ absolutely/RB untrue./NN
"We/NN also/RB attracted/VBD criticism/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN days/NNS players/NNS spent/VBD with/IN the/DT national/JJ team./NN
"But/NN let/NN me/PRP give/VB you/PRP the/DT truth./NN
Our/PRP$ Irish/JJ counterparts/NNS whom/WP we/PRP have/VBP to/TO compete/VB with/IN in/IN a/DT few/JJ days'/NN time/NN had/VBD 70/CD days/NNS together/RB at/IN the/DT summer./NN
"They/NN are/VBP currently/RB in/IN camp/NN now/RB and/CC they/PRP will/MD have/VB another/DT 21/CD days/NNS in/IN camp/NN before/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations./NNP
"That/NN means/VBZ they/PRP will/MD have/VB 91/CD days/NNS away/RB from/IN their/PRP$ club/NN from/IN July/NNP until/IN the/DT Six/CD Nations./NNP
We/PRP on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN will/MD have/VB 16./CD
"There/NN must/MD be/VB a/DT win-win/JJ philosophy/NN and/CC attitude/NN within/IN Scottish/JJ rugby/NN and/CC that/DT is/VBZ what/WP we/PRP are/VBP after/IN -/: both/DT groups/NNS winning/VBG not/RB competing."/NN
