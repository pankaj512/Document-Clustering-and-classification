Williams/NN battles/NNS to/TO Aussie/NNP title/NN

Serena/NNP Williams/NNP staged/VBD a/DT remarkable/JJ recovery/NN to/TO beat/VB Lindsay/NNP Davenport/NNP and/CC win/VB her/PRP$ second/JJ Australian/JJ Open/NNP title./NN

The/DT 2003/CD champion/NN claimed/VBD her/PRP$ seventh/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP title/NN and/CC her/PRP$ first/NN since/IN Wimbledon/NNP in/IN 2003/CD 2-6/JJ 6-3/JJ 6-0./JJ
Williams/NNP had/VBD looked/VBN close/RB to/TO quitting/VBG with/IN a/DT rib/NN injury/NN when/WRB she/PRP left/VBD the/DT court/NN for/IN treatment/NN after/IN five/CD games./NN
She/PRP quickly/RB dropped/VBD the/DT first/JJ set/VBN but/CC from/IN 3-3/JJ in/IN the/DT second/NN found/VBD another/DT gear/NN as/IN Davenport's/NNP game/NN collapsed/VBD allowing/VBG Williams/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT title./NN
Williams/NNP later/RB explained/VBD her/PRP$ injury/NN problem/NN saying/VBG it/PRP was/VBD the/DT result/NN of/IN lunging/VBG for/IN a/DT ball/NN early/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ set./NN
"Lindsay/NN had/VBD me/PRP on/IN the/DT run/NN out/RP wide/JJ on/IN my/PRP$ backhand/NN and/CC my/PRP$ back/RB went/VBD but/CC eventually/RB I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO come/VB back/RB thank/VB goodness"/NN she/PRP said./VBP
Davenport/NNP paid/VBD tribute/NN to/TO Williams/NNP saying/VBG "She's/NN had/VBD a/DT tough/JJ couple/NN of/IN years/NNS and/CC she's/NNS come/VBP back/RB like/IN a/DT champion."/NN

The/DT 23-year-old/JJ former/JJ world/NN number/NN one/CD was/VBD in/IN desperate/JJ trouble/NN in/IN the/DT early/JJ stages/NNS as/IN the/DT injury/NN hampered/VBD her/PRP$ service/NN action./NN
Davenport/NNP took/VBD advantage/NN to/TO race/VB through/IN the/DT opening/NN set/VBN and/CC held/VBN six/CD break/NN points/NNS in/IN game/NN five/CD of/IN the/DT second./NN
"I/NN kept/VBD thinking/VBG to/TO myself/PRP 'I'm/VBP not/RB losing/VBG this/DT game"/NN said/VBD Williams/NNP afterwards./NN
"'I/NN don't/NN care/NN if/IN my/PRP$ arm/NN falls/VBZ off/RP I'm/NNP not/RB losing/VBG this/DT game'./NN
And/CC I/PRP guess/VBP that's/NNS what/WP happened./NN
"I/NN didn't/NN want/VBP to/TO lose/VB that/IN particular/JJ game/NN because/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN her/PRP a/DT lot/NN of/IN momentum/NN and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN confidence."/NN Despite/IN letting/VBG the/DT break/NN points/NNS slip/NN away/RB Davenport/NNP looked/VBD comfortable/JJ enough/RB at/IN 3-3/JJ but/CC from/IN 40-0/JJ up/RP she/PRP just/RB folded./VBP
Williams/NNP won/VBD nine/CD consecutive/JJ points/NNS for/IN the/DT set/VBN and/CC powered/VBN through/IN the/DT decider/NN as/IN a/DT lacklustre/NN Davenport/NNP looked/VBD to/TO have/VB run/VBN out/IN of/IN energy/NN after/IN a/DT gruelling/VBG two/CD weeks./NN
"I/NN felt/VBD like/IN I/PRP was/VBD playing/VBG well/RB and/CC in/IN control/NN pretty/RB much/RB of/IN the/DT match"/NN said/VBD Davenport./NNP
"Then/NN I/PRP just/RB had/VBD that/IN horrible/JJ lapse/NN I/PRP think/VBP serving/VBG up/RP 40-0/JJ and/CC made/VBD a/DT few/JJ errors/NNS and/CC opened/VBD up/RP the/DT door/NN for/IN her/PRP and/CC she/PRP just/RB kept/VBD going/VBG through/IN it./NN
"At/NN the/DT end/NN I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN fatigued/VBN but/CC she/PRP took/VBD advantage/NN of/IN it/PRP and/CC kept/VBD going/VBG -/: she's/NNS a/DT great/JJ frontrunner/NN when/WRB she/PRP gets/VBZ going."/NN
