Murphy/VBG That/DT was/VBD a/DT bruising/JJ battle/NN

That's/NNP what/WP I/PRP call/VBP a/DT tough/JJ game./NN
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB physical/JJ and/CC fair/JJ play/NN to/TO the/DT Italians/NNPS they/PRP made/VBD us/PRP work/VBP very/RB hard/RB for/IN our/PRP$ victory./NN

Their/PRP$ organisation/NN was/VBD very/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC they/PRP proved/VBD again/RB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP getting/VBG better/JJR and/CC better/JJR as/IN the/DT years/NNS go/VBP by./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ by/IN far/RB the/DT strongest/JJS Italian/JJ team/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP faced./NN
We/PRP knew/VBD all/DT along/IN that/IN we/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT huge/JJ threat/NN particularly/RB the/DT first/JJ game/NN in/IN the/DT Championship./NNP
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB like/IN the/DT days/NNS gone/VBN by/IN when/WRB you/PRP could/MD get/VB scores/NNS on/IN the/DT board/NN early./NN
We/PRP had/VBD to/TO work/VB our/PRP$ socks/NNS off/IN and/CC try/VB and/CC build/VB our/PRP$ scores/NNS gradually./NN
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB hard/JJ work/NN out/IN there/RB and/CC the/DT players/NNS have/VBP plenty/NN of/IN bumps/NNS and/CC bruises/NNS to/TO prove/VB it./NN
I'm/NNP not/RB too/RB bad/JJ but/CC there/EX are/VBP one/CD or/CC two/CD others/NNS who/WP will/MD be/VB feeling/NN it/PRP a/DT bit/NN on/IN Monday/NNP morning./NN
In/IN the/DT backs/NNS we/PRP were/VBD not/RB frustrated/VBN at/IN such/JJ but/CC the/DT new/JJ rucking/NN laws/NNS were/VBD a/DT little/JJ bit/NN problematical./NN
The/DT different/JJ interpretations/NNS between/IN the/DT referee/NN and/CC the/DT players/NNS was/VBD a/DT little/JJ difficult./NN
But/CC we/PRP managed/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT ball/NN in/IN our/PRP$ hands/NNS and/CC I/PRP got/VBD a/DT try/NN near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ half./NN
It's/NNP always/RB good/JJ to/TO score./VB
It/PRP was/VBD great/JJ work/NN by/IN Brian/NNP and/CC I/PRP always/RB knew/VBD I/PRP had/VBD scored/VBN even/RB though/IN it/PRP went/VBD upstairs/NN to/TO the/DT video/NN referee./NN
Eddie/NNP (O'Sullivan)/NN was/VBD very/RB calm/JJ at/IN half-time/NN even/RB though/IN we/PRP were/VBD only/JJ 8-6/JJ ahead./NN
He/PRP spelled/VBD out/RP what/WP we/PRP needed/VBD to/TO do/VB and/RB advocated/VBN getting/VBG the/DT ball/NN out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ territory./NN

That/DT new/JJ ruck/NN law/NN made/VBD it/PRP a/DT bit/NN more/RBR difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB out/IN of/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ half./NN
We/PRP were/VBD penalised/VBN a/DT lot/NN at/IN the/DT breakdown/NN and/CC if/IN they/PRP had/VBD kicked/VBN all/RB their/PRP$ chances/NNS at/IN goal/NN we/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN behind/RP at/IN the/DT break./NN
So/RB really/RB we/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO playing/VBG a/DT territory/NN game/NN and/CC simplifying/VBG things/NNS and/CC having/VBG more/JJR patience/NN on/IN the/DT ball./NN
Every/DT one/CD was/VBD a/DT little/JJ down/RP after/IN the/DT game/NN following/VBG the/DT injuries/NNS to/TO Brian/NNP and/CC Gordon./NNP
As/IN yet/RB we/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB the/DT full/JJ extent/NN of/IN the/DT injuries/NNS but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB that/DT good./NN
Now/RB we/PRP have/VBP to/TO focus/VB on/IN Scotland/NNP and/CC only/RB six/CD days/NNS to/TO recover./VB
It's/VBG a/DT big/JJ ask/NN after/IN such/PDT a/DT bruising/VBG encounter./NN
I/PRP was/VBD very/RB impressed/VBN the/DT way/NN the/DT Scots/NNP played/VBD against/IN the/DT French/NN on/IN Saturday./NNP
It/PRP could/MD so/RB easily/RB have/VBP gone/VBN their/PRP$ way/NN but/CC for/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN decisions./NN
We/PRP will/MD be/VB under/IN no/DT illusions/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB tough/JJ for/IN us./NN
In/IN the/DT meantime/NN when/WRB in/IN Rome/NNP .../:
