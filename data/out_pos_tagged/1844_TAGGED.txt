Security/NNP scares/VBZ spark/VB browser/NN fix/NN

Microsoft/NNP is/VBZ working/VBG on/IN a/DT new/JJ version/NN of/IN its/PRP$ Internet/NNP Explorer/NNP web/NN browser./NN

The/DT revamp/NN has/VBZ been/VBN prompted/VBN by/IN Microsoft's/NNP growing/VBG concern/NN with/IN security/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN increased/VBN competition/NN from/IN rival/JJ browsers./NN
Microsoft/NNP said/VBD the/DT new/JJ version/NN will/MD be/VB far/RB less/RBR vulnerable/JJ to/TO the/DT bugs/NNS that/WDT make/VBP its/PRP$ current/JJ browser/NN a/DT favourite/NN of/IN tech-savvy/JJ criminals./NN
Test/NN versions/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ program/NN called/VBN IE/NNP 7/CD are/VBP due/JJ to/TO be/VB released/VBN by/IN the/DT summer./NN

The/DT announcement/NN about/IN Internet/NNP Explorer/NNP was/VBD made/VBN by/IN Bill/NNP Gates/NNP Microsoft/NNP chairman/NN and/CC chief/JJ software/NN architect/NN during/IN a/DT keynote/NN speech/NN at/IN the/DT RSA/NNP Security/NNP conference/NN currently/RB being/VBG held/VBN in/IN San/NNP Francisco./NNP
Although/IN details/NNS were/VBD scant/JJ Mr/NNP Gates/NNP said/VBD IE7/CD would/MD include/VB new/JJ protections/NNS against/IN viruses/NNS spyware/NN and/CC phishing/VBG scams./NN
This/DT last/JJ category/NN of/IN threats/NNS involves/VBZ criminals/NNS setting/VBG up/RP spoof/NN websites/NNS that/WDT look/VBP identical/JJ to/TO those/DT of/IN banks/NNS and/CC try/VB to/TO trick/VB people/NNS into/IN handing/VBG over/IN login/NN and/CC account/NN information./NN

In/IN a/DT bid/NN to/TO shore/VB up/RP the/DT poor/JJ security/NN in/IN IE/NNP 6/CD Microsoft/NNP has/VBZ regularly/RB issued/VBN updates/NNS to/TO patch/VB loopholes/NNS exploited/VBN by/IN criminals/NNS and/CC the/DT makers/NNS of/IN nuisance/JJ programs/NNS such/JJ as/IN spyware./NN
Earlier/RBR this/DT month/NN it/PRP released/VBD a/DT security/NN bulletin/NN that/WDT patched/VBN eight/CD critical/JJ security/NN holes/NNS -/: some/DT of/IN which/WDT were/VBD found/VBN in/IN the/DT IE/NNP browser./NN
Microsoft/NNP has/VBZ also/RB made/VBN a/DT series/NN of/IN acquisitions/NNS of/IN small/JJ firms/NNS that/DT specialise/NN in/IN computer/NN security./NN
One/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ fruits/NNS of/IN these/DT acquisitions/NNS appeared/VBD last/JJ month/NN with/IN the/DT release/NN of/IN a/DT Microsoft/NNP anti-spyware/JJ program./NN
An/DT own-brand/JJ anti-virus/JJ program/NN is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO follow/VB by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN 2005./CD
The/DT decision/NN to/TO make/VB Internet/NNP Explorer/NNP 7/CD is/VBZ widely/RB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT U-turn/NN because/IN before/IN now/RB Microsoft/NNP said/VBD it/PRP had/VBD no/DT need/NN to/TO update/VB the/DT browser./NN
Typically/RB new/JJ versions/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ browser/NN appear/VBP with/IN successive/JJ versions/NNS of/IN the/DT Windows/NNS operating/NN system./NN
A/DT new/JJ version/NN of/IN IE/NNP was/VBD widely/RB expected/VBN to/TO debut/VB with/IN the/DT next/JJ version/NN of/IN Windows/NNS codenamed/VBD Longhorn/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO appear/VB in/IN 2006./CD
The/DT current/JJ version/NN of/IN Internet/NNP Explorer/NNP is/VBZ four/CD years/NNS old/JJ and/CC is/VBZ widely/RB seen/VBN as/IN falling/VBG behind/IN rivals/NNS such/JJ as/IN Firefox/NNP and/CC Opera./NNP
There/EX are/VBP also/RB persistent/JJ rumours/NNS that/DT search/NN engine/NN Google/NNP is/VBZ poised/VBN to/TO produce/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ brand/NN browser/NN based/VBN on/IN Firefox./NNP
In/IN particular/JJ the/DT Firefox/NNP browser/NN has/VBZ been/VBN winning/VBG fans/NNS and/CC users/NNS since/IN its/PRP$ first/JJ full/JJ version/NN was/VBD released/VBN in/IN November/NNP 2004./CD
Estimates/NNS of/IN how/WRB many/JJ users/NNS Firefox/NNP has/VBZ won/VBN over/IN vary/VBP widely./NN
According/VBG to/TO market/NN statistics/NNS gathered/VBN by/IN Websidestory/NNP Firefox's/NNP market/NN share/NN is/VBZ now/RB about/IN 5%/CD of/IN all/DT users./NN
However/RB other/JJ browser/NN stat/NN gatherers/NNS say/VBP the/DT figure/NN is/VBZ closer/JJR to/TO 15%./CD
Some/DT technical/JJ websites/NNS report/NN that/IN a/DT majority/NN of/IN their/PRP$ visitors/NNS use/VBP the/DT Firefox/NNP browser./NN
Internet/NNP Explorer/NNP still/RB dominates/VBZ with/IN a/DT share/NN of/IN about/IN 90%/CD but/CC this/DT is/VBZ down/RB from/IN a/DT peak/NN of/IN almost/RB 96%/CD in/IN mid-2004./JJ
