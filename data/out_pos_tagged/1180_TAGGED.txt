Kennedy's/NNP cautious/JJ optimism/NN

Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP is/VBZ far/RB too/RB canny/JJ to/TO make/VB any/DT grand/JJ claims/NNS about/IN how/WRB his/PRP$ party/NN may/MD fare/VB at/IN the/DT general/JJ election./NN

In/IN his/PRP$ 22/CD years/NNS in/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS he/PRP has/VBZ seen/VBN his/PRP$ fair/JJ share/NN of/IN such/JJ claims/NNS dashed/JJ on/IN the/DT rocks/NNS of/IN bitter/JJ experience/NN and/CC he/PRP might/MD say/VB the/DT UK's/NNP political/JJ and/CC electoral/JJ system./NN
But/CC even/RB his/PRP$ caution/NN cannot/NN hide/VBP the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT party/NN and/CC a/DT leader/NN that/WDT believes/VBZ it/PRP may/MD well/RB be/VB on/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO something/NN special/JJ in/IN a/DT few/JJ months'/NN time./NN
"Look/NN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/VBN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO put/VB any/DT artificial/JJ limits/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ ambitions/NNS this/DT time/NN around"/NN he/PRP said./VB
He/PRP still/RB seems/VBZ to/TO accept/VB that/IN the/DT most/RBS likely/JJ outcome/NN is/VBZ another/DT Labour/NNP victory/NN of/IN some/DT sort./NN
And/CC his/PRP$ general/JJ election/NN pitch/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN around/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN the/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP as/IN the/DT "real"/NN opposition./NN

But/CC doesn't/NN that/WDT lead/VBP to/TO the/DT jibe/NN that/IN his/PRP$ is/VBZ a/DT party/NN actively/RB bidding/NN to/TO come/VB second?/NN He/PRP is/VBZ prepared/VBN to/TO go/VB this/DT far/JJ "A/NN clear/JJ conclusion/NN has/VBZ been/VBN reached/VBN including/VBG by/IN Conservatives/NNS that/IN the/DT Conservatives/NNS are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO win/VB this/DT election./NN
"Therefore/NN the/DT potential/JJ is/VBZ there/RB for/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP advance/NN to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT big/JJ stories/NNS of/IN the/DT election/NN given/VBN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP the/DT capacity/NN to/TO take/VB on/RP Labour/NNP and/CC win/VB as/RB well/RB as/IN take/NN on/RP the/DT Conservatives/NNS and/CC win./NN
"This/NN is/VBZ really/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB the/DT first/JJ modern/JJ three/CD party/NN UK/NNP election/NN that/IN we/PRP have/VBP all/DT experienced"./NN
But/CC haven't/NN we/PRP been/VBN here/RB before/IN with/IN suggestions/NNS in/IN the/DT 1980s/CD that/IN Labour/NNP was/VBD finished./NN
Won't/NN voters/NNS looking/VBG for/IN an/DT alternative/NN to/TO Labour/NNP still/RB naturally/RB gravitate/NN to/TO the/DT Conservatives?/NNP "The/NN problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN geographically/RB the/DT Conservative/JJ party/NN has/VBZ melted/VBN away/RB in/IN about/IN a/DT third/NN of/IN Britain./NNP
"We/NN have/VBP supplanted/VBN them/PRP as/IN the/DT main/JJ alternative/NN to/TO Labour/NNP in/IN whole/JJ tracts/NNS of/IN mainland/JJ Britain./NNP
And/CC they/PRP are/VBP a/DT party/NN with/IN an/DT ageing/VBG and/CC declining/VBG membership/NN base/NN and/CC they/PRP just/RB do/VBP not/RB look/VB vibrant/JJ or/CC vital/JJ or/CC in/IN touch/NN any/DT longer/RBR with/IN contemporary/JJ Britain"./NNP

Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP is/VBZ also/RB eager/JJ to/TO dispel/VB any/DT impression/NN his/PRP$ party/NN is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ party/NN of/IN the/DT left/NN and/CC is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO attract/VB mostly/RB disillusioned/JJ Labour/NNP voters./NN

He/PRP insists/VBZ his/PRP$ three/CD headline/NN commitments/NNS to/TO be/VB financed/VBN from/IN a/DT 1%/CD tax/NN increase/NN on/IN those/DT earning/VBG over/IN Â£100000/CD a/DT year/NN will/MD appeal/VB right/NN across/IN the/DT political/JJ spectrum./NN
They/PRP are/VBP to/TO replace/VB the/DT council/NN tax/NN with/IN a/DT local/JJ income/NN tax/NN provide/VBP free/JJ long/JJ term/NN care/NN for/IN the/DT elderly/JJ and/CC scrap/VB student/NN fees./NN
He/PRP also/RB believes/VBZ being/VBG the/DT only/JJ major/JJ party/NN promising/VBG to/TO increases/NNS taxes/NNS will/MD not/RB land/VB him/PRP in/IN the/DT same/JJ trouble/NN a/DT similar/JJ policy/NN did/VBD to/TO Old/NNP Labour./NNP
"I/NN think/VBP the/DT tax/NN argument/NN has/VBZ moved/VBN on/IN a/DT lot/NN in/IN British/JJ politics/NNS particularly/RB in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT forthcoming/JJ general/JJ election"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Under/IN a/DT Labour/NNP government/NN the/DT tax/NN burden/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO rise/VB while/IN the/DT Tories'/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO increase/VB spending/NN in/IN some/DT areas/NNS while/IN also/RB reducing/VBG taxes/NNS is/VBZ just/RB incredible/JJ he/PRP claims./VB

"We/NN are/VBP being/VBG straightforward/JJ with/IN people/NNS saying/VBG you/PRP know/VBP there/EX is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT tax/NN burden/NN we/PRP are/VBP only/RB recommending/VBG one/CD specific/JJ tax/NN rise/NN for/IN the/DT top/JJ end/NN of/IN income/NN scale/NN earners/NNS to/TO fund/VB three/CD specific/JJ policies"./NN

"That/NN is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ cut/NN choice/NN for/IN people/NNS one/CD I/PRP am/VBP very/RB comfortable/JJ with/IN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP will/MD distinguish/VB us/PRP from/IN the/DT others"./NN
As/IN to/TO his/PRP$ own/JJ future/NN he/PRP is/VBZ clear./NN
If/IN as/IN expected/VBN his/PRP$ party/NN increases/VBZ its/PRP$ showing/VBG at/IN the/DT election/NN he/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO go/VB into/IN the/DT next/JJ parliament/NN "on/NN the/DT front/JJ foot/NN with/IN a/DT view/NN to/TO leading/VBG it/PRP right/RB through/IN that/DT parliament/NN into/IN the/DT next/JJ election/NN because/IN I/PRP see/VBP that/IN as/IN the/DT decisive/JJ opportunity/NN for/IN us"./NN
That/DT last/JJ remark/NN reflects/VBZ a/DT view/NN gaining/VBG ground/NN in/IN Westminster/NNP that/IN if/IN the/DT Tories/NNPS do/VBP as/RB badly/RB as/IN some/DT fear/NN the/DT election/NN after/IN next/JJ might/MD really/RB see/VB that/IN historic/JJ breakthrough/NN by/IN the/DT third/JJ party./NN
Perhaps/RB then/RB Mr/NNP Kennedy/NNP will/MD be/VB ready/JJ to/TO put/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT caution/NN to/TO one/CD side./NN
