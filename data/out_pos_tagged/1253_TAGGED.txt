But/CC he/PRP said/VBD local/JJ governments/NNS had/VBD to/TO deliver/VB good/JJ services/NNS without/IN big/JJ council/NN tax/NN rises./NN

The/DT central/JJ government/NN cash/NN is/VBZ part/NN of/IN a/DT £1bn/CD package/NN to/TO help/VB local/JJ authorities/NNS in/IN England/NNP keep/VBP next/JJ year's/NNS council/NN tax/NN rises/NNS below/IN 5%/CD in/IN what/WP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT general/JJ election/NN year./NN
