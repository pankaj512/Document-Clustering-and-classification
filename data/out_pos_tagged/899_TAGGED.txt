Patricia/NNP Hewitt/NNP said/VBD the/DT cost/NN of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS was/VBD being/VBG evaluated/VBN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD an/DT "increasingly/RB high/JJ priority"/NN and/CC a/DT "shared/VBN goal/NN across/IN government"./NN
Ms/NNP Hewitt/NNP was/VBD speaking/VBG at/IN a/DT gender/NN and/CC productivity/NN seminar/NN organised/VBN by/IN the/DT Equal/NNP Opportunities/NNPS Commission/NNP (EOC)./NN
Mothers/NNS can/MD currently/RB take/VB up/RP to/TO six/CD months'/NN paid/VBN leave/NN -/: and/CC six/CD unpaid./NN
Ms/NNP Hewitt/NNP told/VBD the/DT seminar/NN "Clearly/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS we/PRP need/VBP to/TO do/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN is/VBZ to/TO extend/VB the/DT period/NN of/IN payment/NN for/IN maternity/NN leave/NN beyond/IN the/DT first/JJ six/CD months/NNS into/IN the/DT second/JJ six/CD months./NN
"We/NN are/VBP looking/VBG at/IN how/WRB quickly/RB we/PRP can/MD do/VB that/DT because/IN obviously/RB there/EX are/VBP cost/NN implications/NNS because/IN the/DT taxpayer/NN reimburses/VBZ the/DT employers/NNS for/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN that."/NN

Ms/NNP Hewitt/NNP also/RB announced/VBD a/DT new/JJ drive/NN to/TO help/VB women/NNS who/WP want/VBP to/TO work/VB in/IN male/JJ dominated/VBN sectors/NNS saying/VBG sexism/NN at/IN work/NN was/VBD still/RB preventing/VBG women/NNS reaching/VBG their/PRP$ full/JJ potential./NN

The/DT minister/NN told/VBD delegates/NNS that/IN getting/VBG rid/JJ of/IN "career/NN sexism"/NN was/VBD vital/JJ to/TO closing/NN the/DT gender/NN pay/NN gap./NN

"Career/NN sexism/NN limits/NNS opportunities/NNS for/IN women/NNS of/IN all/DT ages/NNS and/CC prevents/VBZ them/PRP from/IN achieving/VBG their/PRP$ full/JJ potential./NN
"It/NN is/VBZ simply/RB wrong/JJ to/TO assume/VB someone/NN cannot/NN do/VBP a/DT job/NN on/IN the/DT grounds/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ sex"/NN she/PRP said./VBP
Earlier/RBR she/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP 4's/CD Today/NN programme/NN "What/NN we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN about/IN six/CD out/IN of/IN 20/CD women/NNS work/VBP in/IN jobs/NNS that/WDT are/VBP low-paid/JJ and/CC typically/RB dominated/VBN by/IN women/NNS so/IN we/PRP have/VBP got/VBN very/RB segregated/VBN employment./NN
"Unfortunately/RB in/IN some/DT cases/NNS this/DT reflects/VBZ very/RB old-fashioned/JJ and/CC stereotypical/JJ ideas/NNS about/IN the/DT appropriate/JJ jobs/NNS for/IN women/NNS or/CC indeed/RB for/IN men./NN
"Career/NN sexism/NN is/VBZ about/IN saying/VBG that/DT engineering/NN for/IN instance/NN where/WRB only/RB 10%/CD of/IN employees/NNS are/VBP women/NNS is/VBZ really/RB a/DT male-dominated/JJ industry./NN
Construction/NN is/VBZ even/RB worse./NN
"But/NN it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB about/IN saying/VBG childcare/NN jobs/NNS are/VBP really/RB there/RB for/IN women/NNS and/CC not/RB suitable/JJ for/IN men./NN
Career/NNP sexism/NN goes/VBZ both/DT ways."/NN

She/PRP added/VBD that/IN while/IN progress/NN had/VBD been/VBN made/VBN there/EX was/VBD still/RB a/DT gap/NN in/IN pay/NN figures./NN
"The/NN average/JJ woman/NN working/VBG full-time/JJ is/VBZ being/VBG paid/VBN about/IN 80p/CD for/IN every/DT pound/NN a/DT man/NN is/VBZ earning./NN
For/IN women/NNS working/VBG part-time/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ 60p."/CD The/DT Department/NNP for/IN Trade/NNP and/CC Industry/NNP will/MD also/RB provide/VB funding/NN to/TO help/VB a/DT new/JJ pay/NN experts/NNS panel/NN run/NN by/IN the/DT TUC./NNP

Research/NNP conducted/VBD by/IN the/DT EOC/NNP last/JJ year/NN revealed/VBD that/IN many/JJ Britons/NNP believe/VBP the/DT pay/NN gap/NN between/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS is/VBZ the/DT result/NN of/IN "natural/JJ differences"/NN between/IN the/DT sexes./NN
Women/NNP hold/VB less/JJR than/IN 10%/CD of/IN the/DT top/JJ positions/NNS in/IN FTSE/NNP 100/CD companies/NNS the/DT police/NN the/DT judiciary/NN and/CC trade/NN unions/NNS according/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ figures./NN
