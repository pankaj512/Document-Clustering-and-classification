O'Sullivan/NNP keeps/VBZ his/PRP$ powder/NN dry/JJ

When/WRB you/PRP are/VBP gunning/VBG for/IN glory/NN and/CC ultimate/JJ success/NN keeping/VBG the/DT gunpowder/NN dry/JJ is/VBZ essential./NN

Ireland/NNP coach/NN Eddie/NNP O'Sullivan/NNP appears/VBZ to/TO have/VB done/VBN that/IN quite/RB successfully/RB in/IN the/DT run-up/NN to/TO this/DT season's/NNS Six/CD Nations/NNPS Championship./NNP
He/PRP decreed/VBD after/IN the/DT 2003/CD World/NNP Cup/NNP that/IN players/NNS should/MD have/VB a/DT decent/JJ conditioning/NN period/NN during/IN the/DT year./NN
That/DT became/VBD a/DT reality/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN last/JJ summer/NN with/IN a/DT 10-week/JJ period/NN at/IN the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT this/DT season./NN
It/PRP may/MD have/VB annoyed/JJ his/PRP$ Scottish/NNP and/CC in/IN particularly/RB Welsh/NNP cousins/NNS who/WP huffed/VBD and/CC puffed/VBD at/IN the/DT disrespect/JJ apparently/RB shown/VBN to/TO the/DT Celtic/NNP League./NNP
We/PRP will/MD say/VB nothing/NN of/IN Mike/NNP Ruddock/NNP ''poaching''/NN eight/CD of/IN the/DT Dragons/NNP side/NN that/WDT faced/VBD Leinster/NNP on/IN Sunday./NNP
But/CC like/IN O'Sullivan/NNP he/PRP was/VBD well/RB within/IN his/PRP$ rights/NNS particularly/RB when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN the/DT national/JJ side/NN and/CC pride/NN that/WDT goes/VBZ along/IN with/IN it./NN
The/DT IRFU/NNP has/VBZ thrown/VBN their/PRP$ weight/NN behind/IN O'Sullivan/NNP who/WP must/MD be/VB glad/JJ that/IN in/IN the/DT main/JJ there/EX is/VBZ centrally-controlled/JJ contracts./NN
Bar/NNP Keith/NNP Gleeson/NNP who/WP is/VBZ just/RB returning/VBG from/IN a/DT broken/VBN leg/NN everyone/NN of/IN O'Sullivan's/NNP squad/NN is/VBZ fit/VB fresh/JJ and/CC standing/NN at/IN the/DT oche/NN ready/JJ to/TO launch/VB this/DT season's/NNS campaign./NN

But/CC I/PRP doubt/VBP whether/IN O'Sullivan/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO gloat/VB about/IN the/DT handling/NN of/IN his/PRP$ players./NN
He/PRP is/VBZ not/RB that/DT sort/NN of/IN person./NN
However/RB he/PRP may/MD look/VB at/IN the/DT overworked/VBN and/CC injury-hit/JJ England/NNP Wales/NNP and/CC France/NNP squads/NNS whose/WP$ players/NNS have/VBP been/VBN overworked/VBN and/CC then/RB pat/NN himself/PRP on/IN the/DT back/NN for/IN his/PRP$ foresight./NN
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ still/RB the/DT question/NN of/IN turning/VBG up/RB and/CC transferring/VBG that/DT freshness/NN into/IN positive/JJ results/NNS when/WRB the/DT referee/NN signals/NNS the/DT start/NN of/IN the/DT game./NN
Already/RB Ireland/NNP are/VBP being/VBG earmarked/VBN as/IN hot/JJ favourites/NNS in/IN many/JJ quarters/NNS to/TO go/VB the/DT whole/JJ hog/NN this/DT season./NN
A/DT first/JJ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP since/IN Karl/NNP Mullen's/NNP led/VBD the/DT team/NN to/TO a/DT clean/JJ sweep/NN in/IN 1948./CD
With/IN England/NNP and/CC France/NNP visiting/VBG Lansdowne/NNP Road/NNP for/IN the/DT last/JJ time/NN before/IN the/DT old/JJ darling/NN is/VBZ pulled/VBN down/RB everything/NN looks/VBZ perfectly/RB placed./NN
But/CC in/IN the/DT days/NNS of/IN yore/NN that/WDT frightened/VBD the/DT life/NN out/IN of/IN any/DT Irishman./NNP

Under/IN the/DT burden/NN of/IN great/JJ expectations/NNS Ireland/NNP have/VBP crumpled./NN
Take/VB the/DT Triple/JJ Crown-winning/NNP side/NN of/IN 1985/CD under/IN Mick/NNP Doyle./NNP
They/PRP were/VBD expected/VBN to/TO up/RB the/DT ante/NN further/RBR for/IN a/DT Grand/NNP Slam/NNP only/RB the/DT second/NN in/IN Ireland's/NNP history./NN
What/WP happened/VBD in/IN 1986?/CD Whitewashed./NNP
You/PRP see/VBP Ireland/NNP in/IN any/DT sport/NN love/NN to/TO be/VB downsized./NN
Then/RB they/PRP can/MD go/VB out/RB and/CC prove/VB a/DT point/NN to/TO the/DT contrary./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT beast./NN
But/CC O'Sullivan's/NNP side/NN are/VBP very/RB capable/JJ of/IN proving/VBG a/DT salient/NN point/NN this/DT season./NN
After/IN their/PRP$ first/JJ Triple/JJ Crown/NNP for/IN 19/CD years/NNS they/PRP can/MD live/VB up/RP to/TO their/PRP$ success/NN and/CC take/VB a/DT further/JJ step/NN up/IN the/DT ladder./NN
O'Sullivan/NNP has/VBZ kept/VBN faith/NN and/CC displayed/VBN loyalty/NN to/TO his/PRP$ players/NNS and/CC they/PRP have/VBP repaid/VBN him/PRP in/IN spades/NNS .../:
and/CC there/EX is/VBZ more/JJR to/TO come./VB
He/PRP has/VBZ some/DT old/JJ dogs/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ squad/NN but/CC he/PRP will/MD come/VB to/TO this/DT season's/NNS championship/NN with/IN a/DT different/JJ box/NN of/IN tricks/NNS and/CC a/DT new/JJ verve/NN to/TO succeed./VB
Ireland/NNP can/MD indeed/RB succeed/VB but/CC just/RB whisper/NN it./NN
