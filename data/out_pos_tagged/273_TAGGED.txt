Markets/NNS fall/NN on/IN weak/JJ dollar/NN fears/NNS

Rising/VBG oil/NN prices/NNS and/CC the/DT sinking/VBG dollar/NN hit/VBD shares/NNS on/IN Monday/NNP after/IN a/DT finance/NN ministers'/NN meeting/NN and/CC stern/JJ words/NNS from/IN Fed/NNP chief/NN Alan/NNP Greenspan./NNP

The/DT London/NNP FTSE/NNP fell/VBD 0.8%/CD while/IN Tokyo's/NNP Nikkei/NNP 225/CD dropped/VBD 2.11%/CD its/PRP$ steepest/JJ fall/NN in/IN three/CD months./NN
G20/CD finance/NN ministers/NNS said/VBD nothing/NN about/IN supporting/VBG the/DT dollar/NN whose/WP$ slide/NN could/MD further/RBR jeopardise/NN growth/NN in/IN Japan/NNP and/CC Europe./NNP
And/CC Mr/NNP Greenspan/NNP warned/VBD Asian/JJ states/NNS could/MD soon/RB stop/VB funding/VBG the/DT US/PRP deficit./VBP

On/IN Monday/NNP afternoon/NN the/DT euro/NN was/VBD close/RB to/TO an/DT all-time/JJ high/NN against/IN the/DT dollar/NN at/IN above/IN $1.30./CD
Oil/NNP pushed/VBD higher/RBR too/RB on/IN Monday/NNP as/IN investors/NNS fretted/VBD about/IN cold/JJ weather/NN in/IN the/DT US/PRP and/CC Europe/NNP and/CC a/DT potential/JJ output/NN cut/NN from/IN oil/NN producers'/NN group/NN Opec/NNP although/IN prices/NNS had/VBD cooled/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT day./NN
In/IN London/NNP the/DT benchmark/NN Brent/NNP crude/JJ price/NN closed/VBD down/RB 51/CD cents/NNS at/IN $44.38/CD a/DT barrel/NN while/IN New/NNP York/NNP light/JJ sweet/JJ crude/NN closed/VBD down/RB 25/CD cents/NNS at/IN $48.64/CD a/DT barrel./NN
The/DT slide/NN comes/VBZ as/IN the/DT US/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN attempting/VBG to/TO talk/VB up/RP the/DT traditional/JJ "strong/NN dollar"/NN policy./NN

The/DT latest/JJS to/TO pitch/VB in/IN has/VBZ been/VBN President/NNP George/NNP W/NNP Bush/NNP himself/PRP who/WP told/VBD the/DT Asia/NNP Pacific/NNP Economic/NNP Co-operation/NNP (Apec)/NN summit/NN in/IN Chile/NNP that/IN he/PRP remained/VBD committed/VBN to/TO halving/VBG the/DT budget/NN deficit./NN
Together/RB with/IN a/DT $500bn/CD trade/NN gap/NN the/DT red/JJ ink/NN spreading/VBG across/IN America's/NNP public/JJ finances/NNS is/VBZ widely/RB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT key/JJ factor/NN driving/VBG the/DT dollar/NN lower./NN
And/CC last/JJ week/NN US/PRP Treasury/NNP Secretary/NNP John/NNP Snow/NNP told/VBD an/DT audience/NN in/IN the/DT UK/NNP that/IN the/DT policy/NN remained/VBD unaltered./NN
But/CC he/PRP also/RB said/VBD that/IN the/DT rate/NN was/VBD entirely/RB up/IN to/TO the/DT markets/NNS -/: a/DT signal/NN which/WDT traders/NNS took/VBD as/RP advice/NN to/TO sell/VB the/DT dollar./NN
Some/DT had/VBD looked/VBN to/TO the/DT G20/CD meeting/NN for/IN direction./NN
But/CC Mr/NNP Snow/NNP made/VBD clear/JJ exchange/NN rates/NNS had/VBD not/RB been/VBN on/IN the/DT agenda./NN

For/IN the/DT US/PRP government/VBP letting/VBG the/DT dollar/NN drift/NN is/VBZ a/DT useful/JJ short-term/JJ fix./NN

US/PRP exports/VBZ get/VBP more/RBR affordable/JJ helping/NN perhaps/RB to/TO close/VB the/DT trade/NN gap./NN
In/IN the/DT meantime/NN the/DT debt/NN keeps/VBZ getting/VBG bigger/JJR with/IN Congress/NNP authorising/VBG an/DT $800bn/CD rise/NN in/IN what/WP the/DT US/PRP can/MD owe/VB -/: taking/VBG the/DT total/JJ to/TO $8.2/CD trillion./NN
But/CC in/IN a/DT speech/NN on/IN Friday/NNP Federal/NNP Reserve/NNP chairman/NN Alan/NNP Greenspan/NNP warned/VBD that/IN in/IN the/DT longer/JJR term/NN things/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO get/VB tricky./NN
At/IN present/JJ much/NN of/IN gap/NN in/IN both/DT public/JJ debt/NN is/VBZ covered/VBN by/IN selling/VBG bonds/NNS to/TO Asian/JJ states/NNS such/JJ as/IN Japan/NNP and/CC China/NNP since/IN the/DT dollar/NN is/VBZ seen/VBN as/IN the/DT world's/NNS reserve/NN currency./NN
Similarly/RB Asian/JJ investment/NN helps/VBZ bridge/VBG the/DT gap/NN in/IN the/DT current/JJ account/NN -/: the/DT deficit/NN between/IN what/WP the/DT US/PRP as/IN a/DT whole/NN spends/NNS and/CC what/WP it/PRP earns./NN
But/CC already/RB they/PRP are/VBP turning/VBG more/RBR cautious/JJ -/: an/DT auction/NN of/IN debt/NN in/IN August/NNP found/VBD few/JJ takers./NN
And/CC Mr/NNP Greenspan/NNP said/VBD that/DT could/MD turn/VB into/IN a/DT trend/NN if/IN the/DT fall/NN of/IN the/DT dollar/NN kept/VBD eating/VBG into/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN those/DT investments./NN
"It/NN seems/VBZ persuasive/JJ that/WDT given/VBN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT US/PRP current/JJ account/NN deficit/NN a/DT diminished/JJ appetite/NN for/IN adding/VBG to/TO dollar/VB balances/VBZ must/MD occur/VB at/IN some/DT point"/NN he/PRP said./VB
