He/PRP added/VBD "Ninety/NN percent/NN of/IN our/PRP$ customers/NNS will/MD see/VB real/JJ increases/NNS in/IN speed./NN

"These/NN speed/NN increases/NNS will/MD give/VB people/NNS the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO do/VB a/DT lot/NN more/JJR with/IN their/PRP$ broadband/NN connections"/NN he/PRP said./VB
Upload/NN speeds/NNS -/: the/DT speed/NN at/IN which/WDT information/NN is/VBZ sent/VBN from/IN a/DT PC/NN via/IN broadband/NN -/: will/MD remain/VB at/IN the/DT same/JJ speed/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Ingram./NNP
