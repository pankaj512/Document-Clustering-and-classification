Miles/NNP Shipside/NNP commercial/JJ director/NN at/IN Rightmove/NNP said/VBD sellers/NNS would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB "more/NN realistic/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ asking/VBG prices"/NN to/TO tempt/VB buyers./NN

"Even/NN once/RB the/DT quieter/NN holiday/NN period/NN is/VBZ over/IN sellers/NNS will/MD find/VB themselves/PRP competing/VBG with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN other/JJ properties/NNS on/IN the/DT market./NN

"The/NN proof/NN is/VBZ that/IN some/DT properties/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN appropriately/RB discounted/VBN are/VBP selling/VBG even/RB in/IN the/DT current/JJ market."/NN Overall/RB asking/VBG prices/NNS have/VBP fallen/VBN 3.3%/CD from/IN their/PRP$ July/NNP peaks/NNS as/IN the/DT equivalent/NN of/IN £6500/CD has/VBZ been/VBN cut/VBN from/IN an/DT average/JJ property./NN
