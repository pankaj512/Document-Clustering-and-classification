Plan/NN to/TO give/VB elderly/JJ care/NN control/NN

Elderly/JJ and/CC disabled/JJ people/NNS would/MD choose/VB how/WRB their/PRP$ own/JJ budget/NN for/IN personal/JJ care/NN was/VBD spent/VBN and/CC organised/VBN under/IN government/NN plans./NN

Ministers/NNS say/VBP elderly/JJ and/CC disabled/JJ people/NNS themselves/PRP not/RB social/JJ workers/NNS should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO decide/VB on/IN their/PRP$ care/NN and/CC stay/VB in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ homes./NN
They/PRP also/RB plan/VBP a/DT supremo/NN for/IN adult/NN services/NNS in/IN each/DT English/JJ area/NN to/TO get/VB different/JJ agencies/NNS working/VBG together./NN
But/CC the/DT government/NN shunned/VBD opponents'/NN calls/VBZ for/IN free/JJ long-term/JJ care./NN

There/EX are/VBP 1.7m/CD people/NNS needing/VBG care/NN in/IN England/NNP and/CC ministers/NNS suggest/VBP the/DT number/NN could/MD quadruple/VB by/IN 2050./CD
Monday's/NNP consultation/NN paper/NN on/IN social/JJ care/NN for/IN adults/NNS in/IN England/NNP is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN ending/VBG a/DT system/NN which/WDT generates/VBZ dependency./NN
Health/NNP Minister/NNP Stephen/NNP Ladyman/NNP said/VBD "This/NN document/NN is/VBZ the/DT antithesis/NN of/IN the/DT nanny/NN state./NN

"It's/NN about/IN taking/VBG power/NN away/RB from/IN the/DT state/NN and/CC giving/VBG it/PRP to/TO individuals/NNS and/CC saying/VBG that/IN we/PRP will/MD help/VB you/PRP make/VB these/DT decisions/NNS but/CC we/PRP are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO make/VB them/PRP for/IN you/PRP any/DT more."/NN The/DT government/NN has/VBZ already/RB allowed/VBN local/JJ councils/NNS to/TO give/VB people/NNS money/VBP so/IN they/PRP can/MD pay/VB for/IN their/PRP$ services/NNS directly/RB but/CC take-up/JJ of/IN the/DT scheme/NN has/VBZ been/VBN "disappointing"./NN

Ministers/NNS say/VBP the/DT new/JJ plans/NNS would/MD make/VB direct/JJ payments/NNS simpler/JJR and/CC try/VB to/TO counter/VB reluctance/NN in/IN some/DT local/JJ councils/NNS to/TO use/VB the/DT payments./NN
They/PRP also/RB want/VBP to/TO set/VB up/RP a/DT new/JJ "half-way/JJ house"/NN where/WRB social/JJ workers/NNS tell/VBP people/NNS how/WRB much/JJ money/NN is/VBZ available/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ care/NN and/CC help/VB them/PRP choose/VB how/WRB to/TO spend/VB that/IN "individual/JJ budget"./NN
The/DT scheme/NN will/MD be/VB funded/VBN on/IN existing/VBG budgets/NNS set/VBN until/IN 2008./CD
But/CC Mr/NNP Ladyman/NNP said/VBD the/DT plans/NNS could/MD deliver/VB savings/NNS in/IN some/DT areas/NNS such/JJ as/IN freeing/VBG up/RP NHS/NNP beds/NNS and/CC preventing/VBG illnesses./NN
He/PRP ruled/VBD out/RP free/JJ personal/JJ care/NN in/IN England/NNP -/: which/WDT is/VBZ on/IN offer/NN in/IN Scotland/NNP and/CC Wales/NNP saying/VBG it/PRP was/VBD "unsustainable"./NN

David/NNP Rogers/NNP from/IN the/DT Local/JJ Government/NNP Association/NNP said/VBD agencies/NNS were/VBD working/VBG together/RB on/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN innovation/NN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT government./NN
And/CC Tony/NNP Hunter/NNP president/NN of/IN the/DT Association/NNP of/IN Directors/NNS of/IN Social/NNP Services/NNPS said/VBD the/DT plans/NNS could/MD improve/VB dignity/NN and/CC well-being/NN for/IN thousands/NNS of/IN people./NN
But/CC Age/NNP Concern/NN argued/VBD social/JJ care/NN was/VBD chronically/RB under-funded/JJ and/CC older/JJR people/NNS were/VBD being/VBG offered/VBN choice/NN in/IN principle/NN but/CC not/RB in/IN practice./NN
Its/PRP$ director/NN general/JJ Gordon/NNP Lishman/NNP said/VBD "Direct/NN payments/NNS will/MD not/RB work/VB if/IN there/EX are/VBP no/DT services/NNS for/IN people/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN locally."/NN

The/DT Tories/NNPS say/VBP people/NNS who/WP pay/VBP for/IN three/CD years'/NN long-term/JJ care/NN directly/RB or/CC through/IN insurance/NN should/MD be/VB guaranteed/VBN free/JJ care/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN their/PRP$ lives./NN
Tory/NNP spokesman/NN Simon/NNP Burns/NNP said/VBD more/JJR than/IN 80000/CD long/JJ term/NN care/NN places/NNS had/VBD been/VBN lost/VBN since/IN 1997./CD
"After/NN eight/CD years/NNS of/IN persistent/JJ change/NN dogmatic/JJ enforcement/NN of/IN regulation/NN and/CC overbearing/VBG government/NN initiatives/NNS -/: we/PRP need/VBP action/NN not/RB a/DT vision"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Burns./NNP
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP say/VBP they/PRP would/MD fund/VB free/JJ personal/JJ care/NN by/IN a/DT new/JJ 50%/CD tax/NN rate/NN on/IN incomes/NNS over/IN Â£100000./CD
Health/NNP spokesman/NN Paul/NNP Burstow/NNP said/VBD "Promoting/VBG independence/NN sounds/VBZ good/JJ and/CC helping/VBG people/NNS to/TO live/VB in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ homes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT goal/NN we/PRP share./VBP
"But/NN the/DT risk/NN is/VBZ that/DT independence/NN can/MD turn/VB into/IN isolation/NN if/IN the/DT right/JJ support/NN and/CC care/NN is/VBZ not/RB available."/NN
