Wales/NNP hails/VBZ new/JJ superstar/NN

One/CD game/NN into/IN his/PRP$ Six/CD Nations/NNPS career/NN and/CC Gavin/NNP Henson/NNP is/VBZ already/RB a/DT Welsh/NNP legend./NN

A/DT mesmeric/JJ display/NN against/IN England/NNP topped/VBD off/RP by/IN his/PRP$ howitzer/NN of/IN a/DT match-winning/JJ penalty/NN has/VBZ secured/VBN life/NN membership/NN of/IN that/DT particular/JJ club./NN
At/IN 23/CD Henson/NNP has/VBZ the/DT rugby/NN world/NN at/IN his/PRP$ silver-booted/JJ feet./NN
And/CC if/IN his/PRP$ natural/JJ self-assurance/NN and/CC swagger/NN is/VBZ shared/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ Wales/NNP team-mates/NNS then/RB a/DT full-blown/JJ revival/NN could/MD be/VB more/JJR than/IN just/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN hot/JJ air/NN drifting/VBG up/RP from/IN the/DT Valleys./NNP
The/DT "Red/VBN Dragonhood"/NNP subdued/VBD the/DT "Red/VBN Rose/NNP Army"/NNP in/IN most/JJS areas/NNS of/IN the/DT field/NN but/CC Henson's/NNP stellar/JJ performance/NN ensured/VBD their/PRP$ efforts/NNS yielded/VBD the/DT win/NN they/PRP craved/VBD above/IN all/DT others./NN
He/PRP announced/VBD himself/PRP in/IN the/DT game's/NNS opening/NN salvo/NN with/IN a/DT "Welcome/NN to/TO Cardiff"/NNP greeting/VBG for/IN Mark/NNP Cueto/NNP on/IN the/DT gain/NN line./NN
And/CC his/PRP$ defence/NN was/VBD a/DT major/JJ feature/NN of/IN the/DT match/NN his/PRP$ principal/JJ victim/NN poor/JJ old/JJ or/CC rather/RB young/JJ Mathew/NNP Tait./NNP
The/DT England/NNP centre/NN will/MD have/VB spent/VBN his/PRP$ 19th/JJ birthday/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP shuddering/VBG at/IN the/DT memory/NN of/IN how/WRB he/PRP was/VBD up-ended/JJ not/RB just/RB once/RB but/CC twice/RB by/IN Henson's/NNP all-enveloping/JJ tackles./NN

The/DT second/JJ time/NN after/IN the/DT interval/JJ single-handedly/RB lifted/VBN the/DT record/NN Millennium/NNP Stadium/NNP crowd/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB England/NNP were/VBD starting/VBG to/TO show/VB menace./NN
Showing/VBG awesome/JJ strength/NN Henson/NNP nonchantly/JJ held/VBD the/DT bewildered/VBN debutant/NN in/IN mid-air/JJ a/DT master/NN predator/NN toying/VBG with/IN his/PRP$ helpless/JJ prey/VBP savouring/VBG the/DT kill./NN
His/PRP$ kicking/VBG game/NN also/RB prospered/VBD particularly/RB when/WRB he/PRP moved/VBD to/TO full-back/JJ for/IN 10/CD minutes/NNS either/DT side/NN of/IN half-time/NN when/WRB his/PRP$ captain/NN Gareth/NNP Thomas/NNP was/VBD in/IN the/DT sin-bin./JJ
One/CD huge/JJ clearance/NN from/IN Tait's/NNP kick/VBP sent/VBN England/NNP retreating/VBG rapidly/RB while/IN another/DT booming/JJ punt/NN to/TO the/DT right/JJ corner/NN kept/VBD the/DT visitors/NNS pinned/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ half./NN
Henson/NNP was/VBD also/RB creativity/NN personified/VBD one/CD little/JJ chip/NN ahead/RB for/IN Shane/NNP Williams/NNP narrowly/RB missed/VBD its/PRP$ target/NN a/DT precise/JJ cross-kick/JJ forcing/NN Jamie/NNP Noon/NN to/TO fumble/VB the/DT ball/NN into/IN touch./NN
He/PRP also/RB had/VBD a/DT hand/NN in/IN the/DT game's/NNS only/RB try/VBP finished/VBD superbly/RB by/IN Williams/NNP and/CC might/MD have/VB scored/VBN himself/PRP on/IN the/DT half-hour/NN as/IN he/PRP glided/VBD into/IN space/NN only/RB to/TO be/VB scragged/VBN by/IN Tait./NNP
Henson/NNP was/VBD twice/RB repelled/VBN as/IN Wales/NNP laid/VBD siege/NN to/TO the/DT English/JJ line/NN after/IN Charlie/NNP Hodgson's/NNP penalty/NN had/VBD edged/VBN the/DT visitors/NNS in/IN front/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time./NN
But/CC he/PRP was/VBD not/RB to/TO be/VB denied/VBN as/IN the/DT crescendo/NN rose/VBD to/TO a/DT deafening/VBG din/NN and/CC the/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT match/NN fell/VBD to/TO him./VB
Replacement/NNP Gareth/NNP Cooper/NNP made/VBD the/DT most/JJS of/IN a/DT poor/JJ Welsh/NNP scrum/NN by/IN chipping/VBG into/IN space/NN where/WRB Jason/NNP Robinson/NNP was/VBD penalised/VBN for/IN holding/VBG on/RP in/IN the/DT tackle./NN

Five/CD metres/NNS in/IN from/IN the/DT right/JJ touchline/NN 44/CD metres/NNS out/RP it/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT kick/NN Stephen/NNP Jones/NNP who/WP had/VBD seen/VBN a/DT long-range/JJ effort/NN fall/NN agonisingly/RB under/IN the/DT bar/NN would/MD have/VB approached/VBN with/IN confidence./NN
"It/NN was/VBD out/IN of/IN Steve's/NNP range/NN but/CC I/PRP looked/VBD at/IN Gavin/NNP and/CC he/PRP gave/VBD me/PRP a/DT reassuring/JJ nod"/NN said/VBD Thomas./NNP
Henson/NNP surveying/VBG his/PRP$ date/NN with/IN destiny/NN positively/RB relished/VBD the/DT responsibility/NN and/CC the/DT chance/NN to/TO make/VB himself/PRP a/DT hero./NN
Without/IN further/JJ ado/NN he/PRP nervelessly/RB slotted/VBD the/DT kick/NN that/DT ended/VBD five/CD years/NNS of/IN English/JJ dominance/NN and/CC 12/CD years/NNS of/IN waiting/VBG in/IN Cardiff./NNP
"I/NN knew/VBD I/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO get/VB it/PRP before/IN I/PRP even/RB took/VBD the/DT kick"/NN he/PRP said/VBD later/RB his/PRP$ distinct/JJ spikey/NN locks/VBZ freshly/RB gelled/VBN into/IN an/DT appropriate/JJ star/NN shape./NN
"I/NN have/VBP been/VBN getting/VBG them/PRP from/IN that/DT distance/NN all/DT year/NN so/IN it/PRP wasn't/NN a/DT problem."/NN There/EX were/VBD still/RB four/CD minutes/NNS for/IN Wales/NNP to/TO hold/VB out/RB and/CC the/DT frenzy/NN was/VBD such/JJ that/IN Henson/NNP could/MD not/RB even/RB hear/VB Jones/NNP shouting/VBG instructions/NNS at/IN him/PRP from/IN three/CD yards/NNS away./NN
But/CC it/PRP was/VBD Wales/NNP who/WP finished/VBD the/DT game/NN on/IN the/DT attack/NN almost/RB snatching/VBG a/DT second/JJ try/NN in/IN a/DT thunderous/JJ climax./NN
"Just/NN Do/VBP It"/NNP implored/VBD the/DT front/JJ page/NN headline/NN on/IN Saturday's/NNP Western/NNP Mail/NNP newspaper./NN
And/CC thanks/NNS to/TO Henson/NNP Wales/NNP did./NN
