MPs/NNP voted/VBD in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Prevention/NNP of/IN Terrorism/NNP Bill/NNP after/IN Mr/NNP Clarke/NNP agreed/VBD to/TO key/JJ changes/NNS -/: but/CC Labour's/NNP majority/NN was/VBD reduced/VBN to/TO 14./CD
The/DT Bill/NNP now/RB faces/VBZ opposition/NN from/IN peers/VBZ angry/JJ at/IN house/NN arrest/NN proposals./NN
Lord/NNP Strathclyde/NNP Tory/NNP leader/NN in/IN the/DT Lords/NNPS said/VBD ministers/NNS should/MD expect/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB "substantially/RB re-written"./JJ

The/DT Bill/NNP proposes/VBZ "control/NN orders"/NN which/WDT as/RB well/RB as/IN house/NN arrest/NN could/MD impose/VB curfews/NNS tagging/VBG or/CC bans/NNS on/IN telephone/NN and/CC internet/JJ use./NN
They/PRP would/MD replace/VB current/JJ powers/NNS to/TO detain/VB foreign/JJ terror/NN suspects/VBZ without/IN trial/NN which/WDT the/DT law/NN lords/NNS have/VBP ruled/VBN against./NN

On/IN Monday/NNP MPs/NNP voted/VBD 272-219/JJ in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT Bill/NNP after/IN key/JJ concessions/NNS from/IN Mr/NNP Clarke./NNP
The/DT government/NN earlier/RBR saw/VBD its/PRP$ 161-strong/JJ majority/NN cut/NN to/TO just/RB 14/CD as/IN a/DT cross-party/JJ amendment/NN was/VBD narrowly/RB rejected/VBN by/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS despite/IN the/DT support/NN of/IN 62/CD Labour/NNP rebels./NN
Mr/NNP Clarke/NNP won/VBD over/IN critics/NNS by/IN announcing/VBG he/PRP would/MD introduce/VB an/DT amendment/NN in/IN the/DT Lords/NNPS to/TO ensure/VB the/DT most/RBS controversial/JJ control/NN order/NN amounting/VBG to/TO house/VB arrest/NN would/MD be/VB imposed/VBN by/IN judges/NNS and/CC not/RB politicians./NN
Lord/NNP Strathclyde/NNP warned/VBD ministers/NNS that/IN they/PRP should/MD "prepare/VB themselves/PRP for/IN substantial/JJ rewriting/NN of/IN various/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT Bill"./NNP
"They/NN should/MD consider/VB far/RB more/RBR seriously/RB the/DT use/NN of/IN intercept/JJ evidence/NN in/IN any/DT trial/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP should/MD drop/VB the/DT most/RBS objectionable/JJ proposals/NNS which/WDT are/VBP for/IN house/NN arrest."/NN

But/CC Mr/NNP Clarke/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP 4's/CD Today/NN programme/NN he/PRP believed/VBD the/DT changes/NNS he/PRP had/VBD made/VBN to/TO the/DT Bill/NNP to/TO win/VB over/IN critics/NNS in/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS should/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO satisfy/VB colleagues/NNS in/IN the/DT Lords./NNP
"No/NNP Bill/NNP goes/VBZ through/IN Parliament/NNP without/IN detailed/JJ consideration/NN being/VBG made/VBN but/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN what/WP I/PRP announced/VBD yesterday/NN will/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO secure/VB the/DT agreement/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Lords"/NNP he/PRP said./VB

"I/NN have/VBP no/DT desire/NN to/TO make/VB further/JJ so-called/JJ concessions/NNS on/IN the/DT Bill."/NNP Mr/NNP Clarke's/NNP proposed/VBD amendment/NN will/MD be/VB debated/VBN by/IN the/DT Lords/NNPS on/IN Tuesday/NNP without/IN having/VBG been/VBN considered/VBN by/IN MPs./NNP
The/DT debate/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ to/TO result/VB in/IN a/DT vote./NN
Speaking/VBG after/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS debate/NN shadow/NN home/NN secretary/NN David/NNP Davies/NNP said/VBD the/DT bill/NN had/VBD been/VBN "clearly/RB very/RB badly/RB drawn-up"/JJ and/CC that/IN the/DT government/NN was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO rush/VB it/PRP through/IN too/RB quickly./NN
He/PRP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB possible/JJ to/TO "rescue"/VB the/DT government/NN and/CC make/VB the/DT law/NN "tolerable"/NN by/IN amending/VBG it/PRP in/IN the/DT Lords./NNP
"The/NN scope/NN for/IN miscarriages/NNS of/IN justice/NN is/VBZ enormous"/NN he/PRP told/VBD BBC/NNP News./NNP

Mark/NNP Oaten/NNP for/IN the/DT Liberal/NNP Democrats/NNPS said/VBD Monday/NNP night's/NNS vote/NN showed/VBD the/DT government/NN had/VBD "lost/NN the/DT confidence/NN of/IN all/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT House"./NNP
He/PRP said/VBD "They/NN need/VBP to/TO rethink/VB the/DT bill/NN and/CC extend/VB the/DT power/NN of/IN a/DT judge/NN to/TO decide/VB on/IN all/DT control/NN orders/NNS build/VB safeguards/NNS on/IN evidence/NN and/CC create/VB charges/NNS against/IN suspects./NN
"Unless/NN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ movement/NN this/DT bill/NN is/VBZ doomed/VBN to/TO fail."/VB

BBC/NNP News/NNP political/JJ editor/NN Andrew/NNP Marr/NNP said/VBD "I/NN think/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT bill/NN in/IN deep/JJ trouble./NN
It's/NNP been/VBN unravelling/VBG in/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Commons/NNPS -/: it/PRP may/MD unravel/VB further."/NN The/DT government/NN wants/VBZ the/DT new/JJ bill/NN to/TO pass/VB into/IN law/NN by/IN 14/CD March/NNP when/WRB the/DT current/JJ powers/NNS expire./NN
