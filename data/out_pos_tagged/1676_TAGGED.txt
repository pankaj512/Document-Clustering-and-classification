Former/NNP Scotland/NNP international/JJ Finlay/NNP Calder/NNP fears/NNS civil/JJ war/NN at/IN the/DT SRU/NNP could/MD seriously/RB hamper/VB his/PRP$ country's/NNS RBS/NNP Six/CD Nations/NNPS campaign./NN

Four/CD members/NNS of/IN the/DT executive/JJ board/NN including/VBG the/DT chairman/NN David/NNP Mackay/NNP have/VBP resigned/VBN after/IN a/DT simmering/VBG row./NN
And/CC Calder/NNP said/VBD "This/NN is/VBZ terrible/JJ news/NN for/IN every/DT level/NN of/IN Scottish/JJ rugby./NN
"David/NN is/VBZ a/DT successful/JJ businessman/NN and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN if/IN anybody/NN could/MD transform/VB the/DT negative/JJ atmosphere/NN and/CC rising/VBG debt/NN level/NN it/PRP was/VBD him."/NN Mackay's/NNP executive/NN board/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN a/DT power/NN struggle/NN with/IN the/DT general/JJ committee/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ members/NNS elected/VBN by/IN Scotland's/NNP club/NN sides./NN
"He/NN has/VBZ been/VBN driven/VBN out/RP by/IN people/NNS who/WP seem/VBP happier/JJR waging/VBG civil/JJ war/NN than/IN addressing/VBG the/DT central/JJ issue/NN that/IN professional/JJ rugby/NN can't/NN be/VB run/VBN by/IN amateurs"/NN said/VBD Calder./NNP

"In/NN fact/NN I/PRP don't/VBP understand/VB why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP still/RB having/VBG this/DT argument/NN 10/CD years/NNS after/IN professionalism/NN arrived./NN
"But/NN I/PRP don't/VBP believe/VBP the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT SRU/NNP will/MD take/VB this/DT lying/VBG down./NN
"I/NN think/VBP the/DT banks/NNS will/MD be/VB dismayed/JJ at/IN this/DT decision/NN and/CC ultimately/RB it/PRP is/VBZ them/PRP who/WP pull/VBP the/DT strings./NN
"So/NN I/PRP wouldn't/VBP be/VB surprised/VBN if/IN they/PRP reviewed/VBD their/PRP$ position./NN
But/CC in/IN the/DT wider/JJR picture/NN what/WP message/NN does/VBZ this/DT send/NN out?"/NN He/PRP thought/VBD the/DT work/NN of/IN Scotland's/NNP coaches/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN attempting/VBG to/TO arrest/VB the/DT decline/NN of/IN the/DT national/JJ side/NN would/MD be/VB made/VBN much/RB more/JJR difficult./NN
"Matt/NNP Williams/NNP and/CC Willie/NNP Anderson/NNP must/MD be/VB wondering/VBG 'what/NN have/VBP we/PRP walked/VBN into/IN here?'"/NN said/VBD Calder./NNP
"And/NN we/PRP can/MD now/RB expect/VB weeks/NNS of/IN arguments/NNS and/CC acrimony/NN just/RB at/IN a/DT time/NN when/WRB we/PRP should/MD be/VB looking/VBG forward/RB to/TO the/DT Six/CD Nations/NNPS Championship./NNP
"I/NN am/VBP very/RB very/RB disappointed/VBN more/JJR than/IN you/PRP can/MD imagine./VB
Why/WRB do/VBP so/RB many/JJ Scots/NNP have/VBP this/DT knack/NN of/IN turning/VBG on/RP each/DT other/JJ when/WRB the/DT going/VBG gets/VBZ tough?"/NN
