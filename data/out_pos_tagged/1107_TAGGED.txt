The/DT UK's/NNP top/JJ judge/NN has/VBZ revealed/VBN he/PRP has/VBZ clashed/VBN with/IN ministers/NNS about/IN how/WRB the/DT heads/NNS of/IN public/JJ inquiries/NNS are/VBP chosen./NN

Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP said/VBD he/PRP was/VBD determined/VBN his/PRP$ current/JJ veto/NN on/IN whether/IN a/DT judge/NN should/MD chair/VB an/DT inquiry/NN should/MD continue/VB as/IN a/DT guard/NN for/IN judicial/JJ independence./NN
But/CC he/PRP told/VBD MPs/NNP the/DT Lord/NNP Chancellor/NNP Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP was/VBD insisting/VBG he/PRP should/MD have/VB the/DT final/JJ say/VBP in/IN such/JJ cases./NN
Lord/NNP Hutton's/NNP inquiry/NN into/IN the/DT death/NN of/IN Dr/NNP David/NNP Kelly/NNP sparked/VBD debate/NN about/IN who/WP should/MD run/VB inquiries./NN

The/DT government/NN says/VBZ the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN would/MD be/VB unlikely/JJ to/TO go/VB against/IN Lord/NNP Woolf's/NNP wishes./NN
Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP who/WP is/VBZ Lord/NNP Chief/NNP Justice/NNP of/IN England/NNP and/CC Wales/NNP was/VBD giving/VBG evidence/NN to/TO the/DT Commons/NNPS public/JJ administration/NN select/NN committee's/NNS inquiry/NN into/IN public/JJ inquiries./NN
He/PRP said/VBD he/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT choice/NN of/IN Lord/NNP Hutton/NNP who/WP as/IN a/DT law/NN lord/NN did/VBD not/RB come/VB under/IN his/PRP$ jurisdiction./NN
But/CC he/PRP argued/VBD he/PRP should/MD have/VB a/DT veto/NN on/RP whether/IN judges/NNS generally/RB should/MD chair/VB a/DT particular/JJ inquiry/NN and/CC if/IN so/RB which/WDT judge/NN it/PRP should/MD be./VB
In/IN written/VBN evidence/NN to/TO the/DT committee/NN Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP said/VBD "I/NN have/VBP so/RB far/RB failed/VBD to/TO reach/VB an/DT agreement/NN with/IN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN on/IN this/DT issue/NN .../:
I/PRP intend/VBP to/TO maintain/VB my/PRP$ position/NN and/CC will/MD press/VB for/IN this/DT safeguard/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN any/DT future/JJ legislation."/NN

Judges/NNS should/MD think/VB carefully/RB before/IN heading/VBG an/DT inquiry/NN into/IN a/DT highly/RB political/JJ issue/NN such/JJ as/IN the/DT intelligence/NN on/IN Iraq's/NNP weapons/NNS of/IN mass/NN destruction/NN he/PRP said./VB
He/PRP argued/VBD "The/NN subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN the/DT inquiry/NN may/MD be/VB so/RB political/JJ that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB damaging/JJ to/TO the/DT judiciary/NN for/IN a/DT judge/NN to/TO be/VB involved./NN
"In/NN addition/NN the/DT question/NN of/IN whether/IN there/EX should/MD be/VB an/DT inquiry/NN at/IN all/DT may/MD be/VB highly/RB controversial/JJ and/CC if/IN a/DT judge/NN is/VBZ appointed/VBN the/DT judiciary/NN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT appointment/NN may/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN siding/NN inappropriately/RB with/IN the/DT government."/NN He/PRP told/VBD the/DT MPs/NNP "Anything/VBG that/WDT tends/VBZ to/TO undermine/VB the/DT confidence/NN of/IN the/DT public/NN in/IN the/DT judiciary/NN worries/NNS me."/NN

Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP said/VBD the/DT current/JJ rules/NNS were/VBD not/RB written/VBN down/RP but/CC it/PRP was/VBD inconceivable/JJ in/IN practice/NN that/IN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN would/MD overrule/VB his/PRP$ concerns./NN
But/CC that/DT situation/NN could/MD change/VB with/IN new/JJ legal/JJ reforms./NN
The/DT issue/NN had/VBD been/VBN "overlooked"/NN when/WRB a/DT new/JJ agreement/NN was/VBD drawn/VBN up/RP about/IN those/DT responsibilities/NNS and/CC the/DT dispute/NN had/VBD emerged/VBN in/IN later/RB discussions./JJ
"What/NN I/PRP am/VBP asking/VBG for/IN is/VBZ a/DT situation/NN where/WRB if/IN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN cannot/NN obtain/VBP my/PRP$ agreement/NN [on/NN appointing/VBG a/DT judge]/NN it/PRP doesn't/NN happen"/NN he/PRP said./VB

Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP said/VBD he/PRP did/VBD not/RB think/VB there/EX would/MD be/VB difficulties/NNS but/CC he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO establish/VB the/DT principle./NN
A/DT Department/NNP for/IN Constitutional/NNP Affairs/NNP spokeswoman/NN said/VBD Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP and/CC Lord/NNP Falconer/NNP agreed/VBD about/IN what/WP happened/VBD in/IN practice./NN
"Their/NN disagreement/NN is/VBZ about/IN whether/IN the/DT legislation/NN should/MD include/VB a/DT requirement/NN for/IN consultation/NN or/CC concurrence/NN -/: a/DT very/RB narrow/JJ dispute/NN in/IN Lord/NNP Woolf's/NNP words"/NN she/PRP said./VBP
"As/NNP Lord/NNP Woolf/NNP also/RB acknowledged/VBD it/PRP is/VBZ highly/RB unlikely/JJ that/IN the/DT lord/NN chancellor/NN would/MD appoint/VB a/DT judge/NN against/IN the/DT wishes/NNS of/IN the/DT lord/NN chief/NN justice./NN
"Judges/NN are/VBP free/JJ to/TO decide/VB for/IN themselves/PRP whether/IN to/TO accept/VB positions/NNS as/IN inquiry/NN chairs."/NN Parliament/NNP will/MD examine/VB the/DT issue/NN next/JJ year/NN when/WRB it/PRP debates/VBZ a/DT new/JJ bill/NN about/IN public/JJ inquiries./NN
