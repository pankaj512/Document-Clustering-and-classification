Andy/NNP Roddick/NNP was/VBD the/DT only/JJ player/NN to/TO put/VB up/RP any/DT real/JJ resistance/NN at/IN Wimbledon/NNP and/CC Federer's/NNP performance/NN against/IN Lleyton/NNP Hewitt/NNP in/IN the/DT US/PRP Open/NNP final/NN was/VBD breathtaking./NN

A/DT quarter-final/JJ defeat/NN to/TO Mario/NNP Ancic/NNP at/IN Wimbledon/NNP was/VBD disappointing/JJ for/IN the/DT limp/JJ manner/NN of/IN the/DT Briton's/NNP defeat/NN but/CC he/PRP remains/VBZ optimistic/JJ of/IN going/VBG further/JJ next/JJ year./NN

British/JJ number/NN two/CD Rusedski/NNP endured/VBD a/DT rollercoaster/JJ year/NN returning/VBG to/TO the/DT circuit/NN after/IN being/VBG cleared/VBN of/IN a/DT doping/VBG offence/NN in/IN March./NNP
With/IN his/PRP$ ranking/JJ down/RP at/IN 168/CD many/JJ feared/VBN the/DT 31-year-old's/JJ career/NN was/VBD over/IN but/CC he/PRP battled/VBD back/RB in/IN the/DT second/JJ half/NN of/IN the/DT season/NN to/TO re-enter/VB the/DT top/JJ 50./CD

Only/RB veteran/NN Lindsay/NNP Davenport/NNP held/VBD the/DT new/JJ wave/NN at/IN bay/NN a/DT stunning/JJ run/NN of/IN form/NN after/IN Wimbledon/NNP taking/VBG her/PRP to/TO number/VB one/CD ahead/RB of/IN Amelie/NNP Mauresmo/NNP whose/WP$ Grand/NNP Slam/NNP drought/NN goes/VBZ on./NN

A/DT virus/NN ruined/VBD the/DT rest/NN of/IN Henin-Hardenne's/NNP year/NN although/IN she/PRP was/VBD fit/VB enough/RB to/TO win/VB Olympic/NNP gold/NN but/CC Clijsters/NNP had/VBD an/DT even/RB more/RBR miserable/JJ 2004./CD
She/PRP suffered/VBD a/DT serious/JJ wrist/NN injury/NN and/CC then/RB announced/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN her/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN Lleyton/NNP Hewitt/NNP and/CC will/MD be/VB happy/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT year/NN end./NN
In/IN their/PRP$ absence/NN Myskina/NNP thrashed/VBD Elena/NNP Dementieva/NNP in/IN a/DT historic/JJ but/CC woeful/JJ all-Russian/JJ final/NN at/IN the/DT French/JJ Open./NNP
Wimbledon/NNP was/VBD a/DT more/RBR refreshing/NN affair/NN as/IN Sharapova/NNP captivated/VBD SW19/CD showing/VBG nerves/NNS of/IN steel/NN as/IN she/PRP battled/VBD past/JJ Davenport/NNP and/CC Serena/NNP Williams/NNP to/TO take/VB the/DT title./NN

Davenport/NNP was/VBD a/DT strong/JJ favourite/NN for/IN the/DT US/PRP Open/NNP but/CC hampered/VBN by/IN injury/NN lost/VBD to/TO the/DT powerful/JJ and/CC unflappable/JJ Kuznetsova/NNP in/IN the/DT semis./NN
Kuznetsova/NNP went/VBD on/RP to/TO give/VB Dementieva/NNP another/DT Grand/NNP Slam/NNP final/JJ thrashing/NN with/IN the/DT latter's/NNS wayward/JJ serve/NN becoming/VBG one/CD of/IN the/DT talking/VBG points/NNS of/IN the/DT year./NN
With/IN the/DT Russians/NNPS still/RB improving/VBG the/DT likes/NNS of/IN Henin-Hardenne/NNP Clijsters/NNP Davenport/NNP Mauresmo/NNP Venus/NNP and/CC Serena/NNP will/MD need/VB to/TO be/VB fully/RB fit/VB and/CC motivated/VBN in/IN 2005./CD
And/CC it/PRP may/MD take/VB their/PRP$ compatriot/NN Safin/NNP to/TO challenge/VB Federer/NNP on/IN the/DT men's/NNS side./NN
