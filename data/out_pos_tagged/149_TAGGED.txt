Saab/NN to/TO build/VB Cadillacs/NNP in/IN Sweden/NNP

General/NNP Motors/NNPS the/DT world's/NNS largest/JJS car/NN maker/NN has/VBZ confirmed/VBN that/IN it/PRP will/MD build/VB a/DT new/JJ medium-sized/JJ Cadillac/NNP BLS/NNP at/IN its/PRP$ loss-making/JJ Saab/NNP factory/NN in/IN Sweden./NNP

The/DT car/NN unveiled/VBD at/IN the/DT Geneva/NNP motor/NN show/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO compete/VB in/IN the/DT medium-sized/JJ luxury/NN car/NN market./NN
It/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB sold/VBN in/IN the/DT US/PRP said/VBD GM/NNP Europe/NNP president/NN Carl-Peter/NNP Forster./NNP
As/IN part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO make/VB the/DT US/PRP marque/VBP appeal/NN to/TO European/JJ drivers/NNS the/DT car/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ Cadillac/NNP with/IN a/DT diesel/NN engine./NN

GM's/NNP announcement/NN should/MD go/VB some/DT way/NN to/TO allay/VB fears/NNS of/IN the/DT Saab/NNP factory's/NNS closure./NN
The/DT factory/NN in/IN Trollhaettan/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN rumours/NNS about/IN GM's/NNP planned/VBD severe/JJ cutbacks/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ troubled/JJ European/JJ operations./NN
But/CC the/DT group's/VBZ new/JJ commitment/NN to/TO the/DT Swedish/JJ factory/NN may/MD not/RB be/VB welcomed/VBN by/IN the/DT group's/NNS Opel/NNP workers/NNS in/IN Ruesselsheim/NNP Germany./NNP
They/PRP may/MD now/RB have/VB to/TO face/VB a/DT larger/JJR proportion/NN of/IN GM's/NNP cuts./NN

Neither/DT will/MD the/DT announcement/NN be/VB seen/VBN as/IN unalloyed/VBN good/JJ news/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP since/IN it/PRP reflects/VBZ Saab's/NNP failure/NN to/TO make/VB significant/JJ inroads/NNS into/IN the/DT lucrative/JJ European/JJ luxury/NN car/NN market./NN
For/IN years/NNS Saab/NNP has/VBZ consistently/RB said/VBN it/PRP is/VBZ competing/VBG head-on/JJ with/IN BMW/NNP Mercedes/NNP and/CC Jaguar./NNP
The/DT segment's/NNS leaders/NNS do/VBP not/RB agree./NN

GM's/NNP plans/VBZ to/TO build/VB the/DT American/JJ marque/NN in/IN Sweden/NNP is/VBZ part/NN of/IN its/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO push/VB it/PRP as/IN an/DT alternative/JJ luxury/NN brand/NN for/IN European/JJ drivers./NN
In/IN the/DT US/PRP it/PRP has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN established/VBN as/IN an/DT upmarket/NN brand/NN -/: even/RB the/DT presidential/JJ limousine/NN carries/VBZ the/DT badge./NN
Yet/CC it/PRP could/MD prove/VB tough/JJ for/IN Cadillac/NNP to/TO steal/VB market/NN share/NN from/IN the/DT majors/NNS in/IN Europe./NNP
Other/JJ luxury/NN car/NN makers/NNS most/RBS notably/RB the/DT Toyota/NNP subsidiary/NN Lexus/NNP have/VBP enjoyed/VBN tremendous/JJ success/NN in/IN the/DT US/PRP without/IN managing/VBG to/TO make/VB significant/JJ inroads/NNS in/IN Europe./NNP
There/EX German/JJ marques/NNS Mercedes/NNP Benz/NNP and/CC BMW/NNP have/VBP retained/VBN their/PRP$ stranglehold/NN on/IN the/DT luxury/NN market./NN

Bringing/VBG Cadillac/NNP production/NN to/TO Sweden/NNP should/MD help/VB introduce/VB desperately-needed/JJ scale/NN to/TO the/DT Saab/NNP factory/NN which/WDT currently/RB produces/VBZ fewer/JJR than/IN 130000/CD cars/NNS per/IN year./NN
That/DT is/VBZ about/IN half/NN of/IN what/WP major/JJ car/NN makers/NNS consider/VBP sufficient/JJ numbers/NNS for/IN profitable/JJ operations/NNS and/CC Saab/NNP is/VBZ losing/VBG money/NN fast/RB -/: albeit/IN with/IN losses/NNS halved/VBN in/IN 2004/CD to/TO $200m/CD (Â£104m/CD 151m/CD euros)/NN from/IN $500m/CD the/DT previous/JJ year./NN
Beyond/IN the/DT 12000/CD job/NN cuts/NNS announced/VBD last/JJ year/NN at/IN its/PRP$ European/JJ operations/NNS GM/NNP is/VBZ reducing/VBG expenditure/NN by/IN building/NN Saabs/NNP Opels/NNP -/: badged/VBN as/IN Vauxhalls/NNP in/IN the/DT UK/NNP -/: and/CC now/RB Cadillacs/NNP on/IN the/DT same/JJ framework/NN and/CC by/IN allowing/VBG the/DT different/JJ brands/NNS to/TO share/VB parts./NN
Another/DT way/NN to/TO further/JJ reduce/VB Saab's/NNP losses/NNS could/MD be/VB to/TO shift/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT production/NN of/IN Saabs/NNP to/TO the/DT US/PRP a/DT market/NN where/WRB drivers/NNS have/VBP adopted/VBN it/PRP as/IN an/DT upmarket/NN European/JJ car./NN
Doing/VBG so/RB would/MD remove/VB the/DT exposure/NN to/TO the/DT weak/JJ US/PRP dollar/VBP which/WDT is/VBZ making/VBG Saabs/NNP more/RBR expensive/JJ to/TO US/PRP consumers./VBP
But/CC not/RB everyone/NN in/IN the/DT industry/NN agree/VBP that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB the/DT best/JJS way/NN forward./NN
"We/NN know/NN that/IN in/IN five/CD years/NNS the/DT US/PRP dollar/VBP will/MD be/VB stronger/JJR than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ today"/NN the/DT chief/JJ executive/NN of/IN a/DT leading/VBG European/JJ car/NN maker/NN told/VBD BBC/NNP News./NNP
The/DT current/JJ trend/NN towards/IN US/PRP production/VBP was/VBD "stupid"/NN he/PRP said./VB

In/IN a/DT separate/JJ announcement/NN GM/NNP unveiled/VBD a/DT new/JJ scheme/NN to/TO allow/VB European/JJ consumers/NNS the/DT chance/NN to/TO test/VB drive/NN its/PRP$ Opel/NNP and/CC Vauxhall/NNP models./NN
It/PRP is/VBZ to/TO deploy/VB a/DT fleet/NN of/IN 35000/CD test/NN cars/NNS across/IN 40/CD countries/NNS inviting/VBG potential/JJ buyers/NNS to/TO try/VB out/RP a/DT vehicle/NN for/IN 24-hours./JJ
It/PRP follows/VBZ a/DT similar/JJ initiative/NN by/IN GM/NNP in/IN the/DT US./NNP
GM/NNP said/VBD it/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO change/VB "customers'/NN perceptions"/NN about/IN Opel/NNP and/CC Vauxhall/NNP cars/NNS showing/VBG them/PRP that/IN the/DT quality/NN had/VBD improved/VBN in/IN recent/JJ years./NN
