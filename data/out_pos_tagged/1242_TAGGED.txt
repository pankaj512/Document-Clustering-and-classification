Labour's/NNP four/CD little/JJ words/NNS

Labour/NNP has/VBZ unveiled/VBN the/DT four/CD little/JJ words/NNS that/WDT will/MD form/VB the/DT heart/NN of/IN its/PRP$ general/JJ election/NN campaign/NN which/WDT for/IN those/DT just/RB returned/VBN from/IN the/DT planet/NN Galifray/NNP is/VBZ "looming"./NN

The/DT slogan/NN "Britain/NN forward/RB not/RB back"/NN (no/NN it's/NNS not/RB an/DT instruction/NN from/IN one/CD of/IN those/DT inter-planetary/JJ Time/NNP Lords)/NNP is/VBZ to/TO become/VB as/RB much/JJ a/DT part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ daily/JJ lives/NNS as/IN the/DT sky/NN -/: it's/NNS always/RB there/RB but/CC we/PRP mostly/RB stop/VBP noticing./NN
The/DT word/NN "Britain"/NN is/VBZ cast/NN on/IN a/DT red/JJ background/NN -/: a/DT nod/NN to/TO Old/NNP Labour./NNP
"Forward"/NN is/VBZ in/IN italics/NNS and/CC cunningly/RB slopes/NNS forward/RB and/CC along/IN with/IN "not/NN back"/NN is/VBZ set/VBN against/IN a/DT mushy/JJ pea/NN green/JJ background./NN
As/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT journalists/NNS assembled/VBN at/IN the/DT unveiling/VBG declared/VBD it/PRP was/VBD all/DT very/JJ post/NN modern/JJ or/CC something./NN
Great/NNP use/NN of/IN colour./NN
Those/DT ad/NN men/NNS really/RB do/VBP earn/VB their/PRP$ money./NN
And/CC coincidentally/RB the/DT ad/NN men/NNS who/WP came/VBD up/RP with/IN the/DT abandoned/VBN flying/VBG pigs/NNS and/CC so-called/JJ "Fagin"/NN posters/NNS which/WDT caused/VBD Tory/NNP protests/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN sacked/VBN but/CC as/IN election/NN supremo/NN Alan/NNP Milburn/NNP declared/VBD "are/NN doing/VBG a/DT very/RB good/JJ job"./NN

Mr/NNP Milburn/NNP in/IN the/DT latest/JJS in/IN his/PRP$ series/NN of/IN pre-election-campaign/JJ campaigning/NN explained/VBD the/DT slogan/NN was/VBD the/DT reaction/NN to/TO polling/VB which/WDT suggests/VBZ the/DT public/JJ believe/VBP Labour/NNP and/CC Tony/NNP Blair/NNP are/VBP the/DT future/NN while/IN Michael/NNP Howard/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories/NNPS would/MD take/VB the/DT country/NN backwards./NN
"Not/NN many/JJ people/NNS talk/VBP about/IN the/DT years/NNS before/IN 1997/CD as/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days"/NN he/PRP declared./VB
It/PRP would/MD be/VB an/DT aggressive/JJ campaign/NN because/IN things/NNS would/MD inevitably/RB boil/VB down/RP to/TO a/DT choice/NN between/IN Labour/NNP and/CC the/DT Tories./NNP

Nobody/NN he/PRP claimed/VBD could/MD picture/VB Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP leader/NN Charles/NNP Kennedy/NNP walking/VBG up/RP Downing/NNP Street/NNP the/DT day/NN after/IN polling./NN
They/PRP could/MD however/RB picture/VB Michael/NNP Howard/NNP or/CC of/IN course/NN Tony/NNP Blair/NNP doing/VBG it./NN
So/RB it/PRP was/VBD only/RB right/NN that/IN the/DT campaign/NN concentrated/VBN on/IN rigorously/RB examining/VBG the/DT opposition's/NNS policies/NNS and/CC past/JJ record./NN
And/CC Tony/NNP Blair/NNP would/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT very/JJ front/JJ line/NN of/IN that/DT campaign/NN he/PRP said./VB
"Between/NN now/RB and/CC the/DT election/NN the/DT prime/JJ minister/NN will/MD be/VB spending/NN more/JJR time/NN out/IN of/IN London/NNP than/IN in/IN it/PRP but/CC in/IN Britain/NNP not/RB overseas"/NN he/PRP promised./VB
"He/NN will/MD be/VB leading/VBG the/DT domestic/JJ debate/NN from/IN the/DT front/NN listening/VBG taking/VBG the/DT flak."/NN So/RB let's/VBZ get/VBP on/IN with/IN it/PRP then./NN
