Michael/NNP Howard/NNP has/VBZ launched/VBN an/DT attack/NN on/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN Britain's/NNP "chaotic"/NN asylum/NN system/NN under/IN Tony/NNP Blair./NNP

The/DT Tory/NNP leader/NN said/VBD English/NNP local/JJ authorities/NNS have/VBP spent/VBN more/JJR than/IN £3bn/CD -/: or/CC £140/CD per/IN household/NN -/: on/IN asylum/NN since/IN Labour/NNP won/VBD power/NN in/IN 1997./CD
Mr/NNP Howard/NNP is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO tell/VB activists/NNS in/IN Kent/NNP that/WDT voters'/NN tolerance/NN and/CC desire/NN to/TO help/VB others/NNS are/VBP being/VBG abused./NN
Other/JJ parties/NNS and/CC refugee/NN agencies/NNS have/VBP already/RB attacked/VBN Tory/NNP plans/VBZ for/IN annual/JJ limits/NNS on/IN numbers./NN

Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD Britain/NNP should/MD take/VB its/PRP$ fair/JJ share/NN of/IN the/DT world's/NNS "genuine/NN refugees"./NN

"The/NN anniversary/NN of/IN the/DT liberation/NN of/IN Auschwitz/NNP -/: where/WRB my/PRP$ grandmother/NN was/VBD murdered/VBN along/IN with/IN over/IN a/DT million/CD others/NNS -/: has/VBZ reminded/VBN all/DT of/IN us/PRP that/IN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT moral/JJ responsibility/NN to/TO those/DT fleeing/VBG persecution"/NN he/PRP was/VBD due/JJ to/TO say./NN
"But/NN if/IN we/PRP are/VBP to/TO fulfil/VB responsibility/NN we/PRP have/VBP to/TO get/VB a/DT grip/NN of/IN the/DT system./NN
"Fair/NN play/NN matters./NN
People/NNS want/VBP a/DT government/NN that/WDT upholds/VBZ the/DT rules/NNS -/: not/RB one/CD that/WDT turns/VBZ a/DT blind/JJ eye/NN when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP bent/NN and/CC abused"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"And/NN let's/NNS be/VB clear./NN
Our/PRP$ asylum/NN system/NN is/VBZ being/VBG abused/VBN -/: and/CC with/IN it/PRP Britain's/NNP generosity."/NN Earlier/RBR this/DT week/NN Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD his/PRP$ party's/NNS plans/NNS to/TO cut/VB immigration/NN were/VBD not/RB racist/JJ arguing/NN they/PRP would/MD make/VB the/DT asylum/NN system/NN fairer/JJR for/IN genuine/JJ refugees./NN
If/IN elected/VBN his/PRP$ party/NN would/MD institute/VB an/DT annual/JJ limit/NN on/IN asylum/NN and/CC all/DT claims/NNS would/MD be/VB processed/VBN overseas./NN

That/DT prompted/VBD some/DT charities/NNS to/TO say/VB the/DT plans/NNS would/MD put/VB refugees'/NN lives/NNS at/IN risk/NN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD turned/VBN away/RB once/RB quotas/NNS were/VBD filled./NN
"If/NN we/PRP have/VBP a/DT moral/JJ responsibility/NN towards/IN people/NNS fleeing/VBG persecution/NN then/RB these/DT policies/NNS will/MD not/RB provide/VB a/DT safe/JJ haven"/NN said/VBD Hannah/NNP Ward/NNP of/IN the/DT Refugee/NN Council./NNP
"If/NN people/NNS turn/VBP up/RP in/IN the/DT UK/NNP asking/VBG for/IN help/VBP they/PRP will/MD be/VB turned/VBN away./NN
Michael/NNP Howard's/NNP policy/NN effectively/RB means/VBZ there/EX is/VBZ no/DT safe/JJ haven/NN in/IN the/DT UK./NNP
"When/NN it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO costs/NNS then/RB perhaps/RB we/PRP should/MD start/VB with/IN how/WRB decisions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN on/IN asylum/NN seekers./NN
So/RB many/JJ of/IN them/PRP are/VBP shown/VBN to/TO be/VB wrong/JJ -/: one/CD in/IN five/CD decisions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP appealed/VBN are/VBP successfully/RB overturned/VBN rising/VBG to/TO half/NN for/IN some/DT nationalities./NN
"We/NN need/VBP good/JJ quality/NN decision-making/JJ on/IN asylum/NN applications/NNS because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ delays/NNS in/IN the/DT system/NN which/WDT cost/NN so/RB much."/NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP said/VBD Labour/NNP would/MD set/VB out/RP workable/JJ plans/NNS for/IN tackling/VBG immigration/NN abuse/NN in/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ weeks/NNS and/CC attacked/VBD the/DT Tory/NNP plans./NN
"By/NN cutting/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN front-line/JJ immigration/NN staff/NN at/IN our/PRP$ borders/NNS they/PRP will/MD actually/RB make/VB the/DT problem/NN worse"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Blair./NNP
Liberal/NNP Democrat/NNP chairman/NN Matthew/NNP Taylor/NNP said/VBD there/EX needed/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT quick/JJ fair/JJ and/CC firm/JJ asylum/NN system./NN
But/CC he/PRP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD "absolutely/RB disgusting"/JJ to/TO propose/VB a/DT system/NN which/WDT could/MD turn/VB away/RB genuine/JJ refugees./NN
The/DT Conservatives/NNS say/VBP there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ risk/NN of/IN this/DT happening/NN as/IN demand/NN for/IN asylum/NN will/MD be/VB considered/VBN when/WRB quotas/NNS are/VBP set./NN
On/IN Monday/NNP Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD "It's/NN not/RB racist/JJ as/IN some/DT people/NNS to/TO claim/VB to/TO talk/VB about/IN controlling/VBG immigration/NN far/RB from/IN it."/NN
