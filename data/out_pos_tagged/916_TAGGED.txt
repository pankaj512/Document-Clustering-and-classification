Concerns/NNS at/IN school/NN diploma/NN plan/NN

Final/JJ appeals/NNS are/VBP being/VBG made/VBN for/IN the/DT government/NN not/RB to/TO ditch/VB the/DT reform/NN plan/NN for/IN England's/NNP secondary/JJ schools/NNS put/VBP forward/RB by/IN the/DT Tomlinson/NNP report./NN

The/DT government's/NNS response/NN to/TO the/DT plan/NN for/IN a/DT four-tier/JJ diploma/NN to/TO replace/VB all/DT existing/VBG 14-19/JJ qualifications/NNS is/VBZ expected/VBN next/JJ week./NN
Some/DT are/VBP worried/VBN it/PRP could/MD be/VB scuppered/VBN if/IN as/IN Tony/NNP Blair/NNP and/CC Ruth/NNP Kelly/NNP have/VBP suggested/VBN GCSEs/NNP and/CC A-levels/NNP stay./NN
Sir/NNP Mike/NNP Tomlinson/NNP himself/PRP was/VBD briefed/VBN only/RB this/DT week./NN
He/PRP is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB feeling/NN more/RBR comfortable/JJ about/IN what/WP the/DT government/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO say/VB than/IN if/IN he/PRP had/VBD read/VBN only/RB what/WP was/VBD in/IN newspapers/NNS in/IN the/DT earlier/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT week./NN
But/CC the/DT government/NN was/VBD said/VBN to/TO be/VB still/RB rewriting/VBG its/PRP$ response/NN on/IN Friday./NNP
"It/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT tragedy/NN if/IN the/DT government/NN comes/VBZ through/RP with/IN a/DT half-hearted/JJ response"/NN said/VBD the/DT chairman/NN of/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS education/NN select/NN committee/NN Labour/NNP MP/NNP Barry/NNP Sheerman./NNP

His/PRP$ main/JJ concern/NN was/VBD the/DT reports/NNS that/IN there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT diploma/NN -/: but/CC only/RB to/TO replace/VB existing/VBG vocational/JJ qualifications./NN
"We/NN must/MD tackle/VB head-on/JJ the/DT structural/JJ mess/NN that/WDT is/VBZ our/PRP$ secondary/JJ education/NN system"/NN he/PRP wrote/VBD in/IN the/DT Times/NNP Educational/NNP Supplement./NNP
"It/NN is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN that/IN the/DT academic/JJ stream/NN in/IN secondary/JJ is/VBZ fine/NN while/IN the/DT vocational/JJ route/NN is/VBZ desperately/RB weak."/VB The/DT Qualifications/NNS and/CC Curriculum/NN Authority/NNP (QCA)/NN has/VBZ also/RB told/VBN the/DT government/NN not/RB to/TO "compromise"./VB
The/DT QCA/NNP said/VBD the/DT potential/JJ "step-change/NN in/IN participation/NN and/CC attainment"/NN lay/VBD in/IN the/DT integrity/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ diploma./NN
"Any/NN partial/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT proposals/NNS would/MD in/IN our/PRP$ view/NN compromise/NN that/DT integrity"/NN said/VBD its/PRP$ chairman/NN Sir/NNP Anthony/NNP Greener./NNP
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT sign/NN of/IN the/DT QCA's/NNP concern/NN that/IN its/PRP$ advice/NN went/VBD to/TO ministers/NNS last/JJ December/NNP but/CC was/VBD publicised/VBN only/RB recently./NN
But/CC people/NNS understand/VBP that/IN a/DT White/NNP Paper/NNP response/NN is/VBZ government/NN policy/NN and/CC has/VBZ to/TO command/VB wider/JJR ministerial/JJ support/NN than/IN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD coming/VBG only/RB from/IN the/DT Department/NNP for/IN Education/NNP and/CC Skills./NNP
They/PRP may/MD be/VB content/NN if/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB "close/VB too/RB many/JJ doors"/NN in/IN writing/VBG -/: whatever/WDT spin/VB is/VBZ put/VBN on/IN it./NN

The/DT chief/JJ inspector/NN of/IN schools/NNS David/NNP Bell/NNP also/RB said/VBD recently/RB that/IN GCSEs/NNP and/CC A-levels/NNP should/MD go./VB
"One/NN of/IN the/DT reasons/NNS why/WRB I'm/NNP so/RB strongly/RB in/IN favour/NN of/IN these/DT terms/NNS disappearing/JJ over/IN time/NN is/VBZ that/WDT it's/NNS good/JJ for/IN the/DT symbols/NNS of/IN change/NN to/TO be/VB seen/VBN right/NN across/IN the/DT system"/NN he/PRP said./VB
"If/NN we/PRP don't/VBP say/VBP this/DT is/VBZ a/DT sea-change/NN in/IN education/NN we/PRP will/MD miss/VB a/DT great/JJ opportunity."/NN Universities/NNS and/CC head/NN teachers/NNS in/IN both/DT the/DT independent/JJ and/CC state/NN sectors/NNS have/VBP also/RB backed/VBD the/DT Tomlinson/NNP proposals/NNS which/WDT include/VBP having/VBG higher/JJR grades/NNS at/IN advanced/JJ level/NN to/TO differentiate/VB between/IN the/DT brightest/JJS students./NN
A/DT note/NN of/IN concern/NN has/VBZ been/VBN expressed/VBN repeatedly/RB by/IN the/DT employers'/NN organisation/NN the/DT CBI/NNP which/WDT complains/VBZ of/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN skills./NN
In/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO address/VB this/DT the/DT Tomlinson/NNP plan/NN is/VBZ for/IN tests/NNS in/IN "functional"/NN maths/NNS and/CC literacy/NN -/: decidedly/RB not/RB GCSEs./NNP
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN suggested/VBN the/DT government/NN will/MD take/VB steps/NNS of/IN some/DT sort/NN to/TO meet/VB firms'/NN concerns/NNS on/IN this/DT score./NN
Another/DT dissenter/JJ is/VBZ Sir/NNP Mike/NNP Tomlinson's/NNP predecessor/NN as/IN chief/JJ schools/NNS inspector/NN Professor/NNP Chris/NNP Woodhead/NNP who/WP has/VBZ said/VBN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT need/NN for/IN such/PDT a/DT "massive/JJ upheaval"./NN
The/DT Conservative/JJ Party/NNP has/VBZ put/VBN forward/RB plans/NNS to/TO revert/VB to/TO a/DT system/NN of/IN having/VBG only/JJ the/DT brightest/JJS percentage/NN of/IN students/NNS each/DT year/NN getting/VBG the/DT top/JJ A-level/NNP grade/NN no/DT matter/NN how/WRB well/RB the/DT others/NNS have/VBP done./NN
