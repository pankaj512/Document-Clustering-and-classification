Blair/NNP rejects/VBZ Tory/NNP terror/NN offer/NN

Tony/NNP Blair/NNP has/VBZ rejected/VBN a/DT Conservative/JJ compromise/NN offer/NN that/WDT could/MD have/VB eased/VBN the/DT passage/NN of/IN anti-terror/JJ legislation./NN

The/DT Tories/NNPS wanted/VBD a/DT sunset/NN clause/NN inserted/VBN in/IN the/DT Anti-Terrorism/NNP Bill/NNP that/WDT would/MD have/VB forced/VBN ministers/NNS to/TO revisit/VB it/PRP in/IN November./NNP
Mr/NNP Blair/NNP said/VBD the/DT bill/NN which/WDT brings/VBZ in/IN house/NN arrest/NN for/IN terror/NN suspects/VBZ had/VBN time/NN limiting/VBG safeguards/NNS already./NN
The/DT Tories/NNPS say/VBP they/PRP will/MD vote/VB against/IN it/PRP unless/IN changes/NNS they/PRP want/VBP are/VBP agreed./NN
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP also/RB oppose/VBP the/DT plans./NN

The/DT government/NN has/VBZ already/RB given/VBN way/NN over/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN judges/NNS in/IN house/NN arrest/NN cases./NN

Mr/NNP Blair's/NNP refusal/NN to/TO accept/VB the/DT Tories'/NNP sunset/NN clause/NN proposals/NNS means/VBZ that/IN the/DT government/NN faces/VBZ concerted/JJ opposition/NN from/IN all/DT sides/NNS in/IN the/DT Lords./NNP
Peers/VBZ begin/VB three/CD days/NNS of/IN detailed/JJ deliberation/NN on/IN the/DT bill/NN on/IN Thursday./NNP
The/DT bill/NN proposes/VBZ "control/NN orders"/NN which/WDT as/RB well/RB as/IN placing/VBG terrorism/NN suspects/VBZ under/IN house/NN arrest/NN could/MD mean/VB curfews/NNS tagging/VBG or/CC bans/NNS on/IN telephone/NN and/CC internet/JJ use./NN
These/DT would/MD replace/VB current/JJ powers/NNS to/TO detain/VB foreign/JJ terror/NN suspects/VBZ without/IN trial/NN which/WDT the/DT law/NN lords/NNS have/VBP ruled/VBN against/IN as/IN a/DT breach/NN of/IN human/JJ rights./NN

The/DT Tories/NNPS want/VBP judicial/JJ oversight/NN of/IN all/DT control/NN orders/NNS not/RB just/RB house/NN arrest./NN
Shadow/NNP Home/NNP Secretary/NNP David/NNP Davis/NNP told/VBD BBC/NNP Radio/NNP Four's/NNP the/DT World/NNP at/IN One/CD his/PRP$ primary/JJ concern/NN was/VBD potential/JJ miscarriages/NNS of/IN justice./NN
He/PRP said/VBD if/IN someone/NN was/VBD wrongly/RB given/VBN a/DT control/NN order/NN it/PRP would/MD act/VB as/IN a/DT "recruiting/JJ sergeant"/NN for/IN terrorists./NN
He/PRP went/VBD on/RP to/TO say/VB "If/NN we/PRP don't/VBP get/VBP the/DT amendments/NNS we/PRP regard/VBP as/IN essential/JJ including/NN the/DT sunset/NN clause/NN we/PRP will/MD vote/VB against/IN the/DT bill."/NN In/IN the/DT Commons/NNPS Mr/NNP Howard/NNP said/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB "far/NN better/RBR if/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT legislation/NN was/VBD subject/JJ to/TO a/DT sunset/NN clause/NN so/RB Parliament/NNP could/MD consider/VB it/PRP all/DT in/IN a/DT proper/JJ way/NN instead/RB of/IN it/PRP being/VBG ramrodded/VBN through"./NN
Mr/NNP Blair/NNP said/VBD the/DT house/NN arrest/NN powers/NNS were/VBD already/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB subject/JJ to/TO a/DT sunset/NN clause/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD annually/RB renewable./NN

The/DT second/JJ less/RBR stringent/JJ type/NN of/IN control/NN orders/NNS would/MD be/VB subject/JJ to/TO a/DT court/NN appeal/NN within/IN 14/CD days/NNS and/CC there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT three-monthly/JJ report/NN on/IN their/PRP$ use/NN by/IN "an/NN eminent/JJ and/CC independent/JJ person"./NN
"I/NN believe/VBP (the/NN new/JJ powers)/NN are/VBP a/DT proper/JJ balance/NN between/IN the/DT civil/JJ liberties/NNS of/IN the/DT subject/JJ and/CC the/DT necessary/JJ national/JJ security/NN of/IN this/DT country/NN that/IN I/PRP will/MD not/RB put/VBD at/IN risk"/NN said/VBD Mr/NNP Blair./NNP
The/DT Lib/NNP Dems/NNP plan/NN to/TO oppose/VB the/DT Bill/NNP in/IN the/DT Lords/NNPS on/IN Thursday./NNP
Lib/NNP Dem/NNP home/NN affairs/NNS spokesman/NN Mark/NNP Oaten/NNP said/VBD "There's/NN a/DT lot/NN of/IN talking/VBG left./NN
I/PRP would/MD be/VB uneasy/JJ about/IN supporting/VBG a/DT very/RB bad/JJ bill/NN even/RB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB for/IN eight/CD months."/NN A/DT spokeswoman/NN for/IN Human/NNP Rights/NNP Watch/NNP said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT "basic/JJ principle"/NN that/IN people/NNS should/MD only/RB be/VB punished/VBN after/IN a/DT fair/JJ trial./NN
She/PRP added/VBD "Having/VBG a/DT judge/NN impose/NN those/DT punishments/NNS without/IN a/DT trial/NN does/VBZ not/RB sanitise/VB them/PRP either."/VBP
