Fidel/NNP Castro's/NNP decision/NN to/TO ban/VB all/DT cash/NN transactions/NNS in/IN US/PRP dollars/VBZ in/IN Cuba/NNP has/VBZ once/RB more/JJR turned/VBD the/DT spotlight/NN on/IN Cuba's/NNP ailing/VBG economy./NN

All/DT conversions/NNS between/IN the/DT US/PRP dollar/VBP and/CC Cuba's/NNP "convertible"/NN peso/NN will/MD from/IN 8/CD November/NNP be/VBP subject/JJ to/TO a/DT 10%/CD tax./NN
Cuban/JJ citizens/NNS who/WP receive/VBP money/NN from/IN overseas/JJ and/CC foreign/JJ visitors/NNS who/WP change/VBP dollars/NNS in/IN Cuba/NNP will/MD be/VB affected./NN
Critics/NNS of/IN the/DT measure/NN argue/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT step/NN backwards/RB reflecting/VBG the/DT Cuban/JJ president's/NNS desire/NN to/TO increase/VB his/PRP$ control/NN of/IN the/DT economy/NN and/CC to/TO clamp/VB down/RP on/IN private/JJ enterprise./NN
In/IN a/DT live/JJ television/NN broadcast/NN announcing/VBG the/DT measure/NN President/NNP Castro's/NNP chief/NN aide/NN said/VBD it/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ because/IN of/IN the/DT United/NNP States'/NNP increasing/VBG "economic/JJ aggression"./NN
"The/NN ten/NN percent/NN obligation/NN applies/VBZ exclusively/RB to/TO the/DT dollar/NN by/IN virtue/NN of/IN the/DT situation/NN created/VBN by/IN the/DT new/JJ measures/NNS of/IN the/DT US/PRP government/VBP to/TO suffocate/VB our/PRP$ country"/NN he/PRP said./VB

The/DT Bush/NNP administration/NN has/VBZ taken/VBN an/DT increasingly/RB harsh/JJ line/NN on/IN Cuba/NNP in/IN recent/JJ months./NN
President/NNP Bush's/NNP government/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT strong/JJ supporter/NN of/IN the/DT 40-year-old/JJ trade/NN embargo/NN on/IN Cuba/NNP introduced/VBD even/RB tighter/JJR restrictions/NNS on/IN Cuba/NNP in/IN May./NNP

Cubans/NNS living/VBG in/IN the/DT US/PRP are/VBP now/RB limited/VBN to/TO one/CD visit/NN to/TO Cuba/NNP every/DT three/CD years/NNS and/CC they/PRP can/MD only/RB send/VB money/NN to/TO their/PRP$ immediate/JJ relatives./NN
A/DT leading/VBG expert/NN on/IN the/DT Cuban/JJ economy/NN says/VBZ that/IN Castro's/NNP tax/NN plan/NN smacks/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT desperate/JJ economic/JJ measure/NN than/IN a/DT political/JJ gesture./NN
"I/NN think/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ primarily/RB an/DT effort/NN to/TO raise/VB some/DT cash"/NN says/VBZ Jose/NNP Barrionuevo/NNP head/NN of/IN strategy/NN for/IN Latin/JJ American/NNP emerging/VBG markets/NNS for/IN Barclays/NNP Capital./NNP
"It/NN underscores/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT economy/NN is/VBZ in/IN very/RB bad/JJ shape/NN and/CC the/DT government/NN is/VBZ looking/VBG for/IN sources/NNS of/IN revenue."/NN

The/DT tax/NN will/MD hit/VB the/DT families/NNS of/IN Cuban/JJ exiles/NNS hardest/RBS as/IN they/PRP benefit/VBP from/IN the/DT money/VBP their/PRP$ displaced/VBN relatives/NNS send/VBP home./NN
This/DT money/NN known/VBN as/IN remittances/NNS can/MD amount/VB to/TO as/RB much/JJ as/IN $1bn/CD a/DT year./NN
Those/DT remaining/NN in/IN Cuba/NNP will/MD have/VB to/TO pay/VB the/DT tax./NN
Their/PRP$ relatives/NNS abroad/RB may/MD choose/VB to/TO send/VB money/NN in/IN other/JJ currencies/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB subject/JJ to/TO the/DT tax/NN such/JJ as/IN euros/NNS or/CC increase/VBP their/PRP$ dollar/NN payments/NNS to/TO compensate./VB
However/RB many/JJ of/IN Cuban's/NNP poorest/JJS citizens/NNS could/MD be/VB worse/JJR off/RP as/IN a/DT result./NN
The/DT tax/NN will/MD also/RB affect/VB the/DT two/CD million/CD tourists/NNS who/WP visit/VBP Cuba/NNP every/DT year/NN particularly/RB those/DT Americans/NNPS who/WP continue/VBP to/TO defy/VB a/DT ban/NN on/IN travel/NN there./NN

Cuba's/NNP tourist/NN industry/NN has/VBZ been/VBN one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ few/JJ economic/JJ success/NN stories/NNS over/IN the/DT last/JJ ten/NN years/NNS and/CC according/VBG to/TO the/DT UN/NNP Economic/NNP Commission/NNP for/IN Latin/NNP America/NNP is/VBZ now/RB worth/JJ $3bn/CD to/TO the/DT country./NN

The/DT tax/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO provide/VB much-needed/JJ revenue/NN for/IN Cuba's/NNP cash-strapped/JJ economy./NN
Cuba/NNP badly/RB needs/VBZ dollars/NNS to/TO pay/VB for/IN essential/JJ items/NNS such/JJ as/IN food/NN fuel/NN and/CC medicine./NN
Much/JJ of/IN Cuba's/NNP basic/JJ infrastructure/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT state/NN of/IN disrepair./JJ
In/IN recent/JJ weeks/NNS Cuba/NNP has/VBZ suffered/VBN its/PRP$ most/RBS serious/JJ power/NN cuts/NNS in/IN a/DT decade/NN and/CC there/EX have/VBP also/RB been/VBN water/NN shortages/NNS in/IN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT island./NN
Cuba's/NNP economy/NN had/VBD staged/VBN a/DT modest/JJ recovery/NN during/IN the/DT mid/NN 1990s/CD as/IN the/DT collapse/NN of/IN the/DT Soviet/NNP Union/NNP forced/VBD it/PRP to/TO embrace/VB foreign/JJ capital/NN decentralise/NN trade/NN and/CC permit/VB limited/JJ private/JJ enterprise./NN
However/RB a/DT decline/NN in/IN foreign/JJ tourism/NN since/IN 2002/CD periodic/JJ hurricanes/NNS and/CC the/DT increasing/VBG costs/NNS of/IN importing/VBG oil/NN have/VBP put/VBN a/DT strain/NN on/IN the/DT economy./NN
It/PRP has/VBZ however/RB yet/RB to/TO be/VB seen/VBN if/IN the/DT tax/NN will/MD provide/VB a/DT solution/NN to/TO the/DT government's/NNS economic/JJ problems./NN
The/DT tax/NN could/MD fuel/VB an/DT active/JJ black/JJ market/NN in/IN currency/NN trading/NN Mr/NNP Barrionuevo/NNP said./NN
"The/NN main/JJ impact/NN could/MD be/VB that/IN it/PRP will/MD create/VB a/DT black/JJ market/NN which/WDT you/PRP typically/RB see/VBP in/IN countries/NNS like/IN Venezuela/NNP which/WDT have/VBP restrictions/NNS on/IN capital"/NN he/PRP says./VB
Mr/NNP Barrioneuvo/NNP says/VBZ the/DT measure/NN could/MD be/VB dropped/VBN if/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT damaging/JJ effect/NN on/IN economic/JJ activity./NN
"It/NN is/VBZ intended/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT permanent/JJ measure/NN but/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/JJ it/PRP can/MD last/VB too/RB long."/NN
