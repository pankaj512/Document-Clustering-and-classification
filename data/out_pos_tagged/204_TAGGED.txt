Some/DT expects/VBZ believe/VBP this/DT could/MD require/VB borrowing/NN of/IN up/IN to/TO $4.5bn/CD trillion/CD over/IN a/DT twenty/CD year/NN period./NN
Despite/IN the/DT Republicans/NNPS holding/VBG a/DT majority/NN in/IN both/DT houses/NNS of/IN Congress/NNP the/DT proposals/NNS will/MD be/VB fiercely/RB contested/VBN over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ months./NN
