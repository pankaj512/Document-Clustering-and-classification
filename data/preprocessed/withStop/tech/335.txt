mobile networks seek turbo boost third generation mobile g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the gsm world congress in cannes last week fast g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second up to times faster than current g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a high speed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than kilobits per second kbps on standard g networks high speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by uk based research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canada based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised ev do us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying ev do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint s vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of bn in multi year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around bn on ev do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of megabits a second and peak download rates of mbps mmo the uk based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of mbps from next summer on its isle of man g network and will eventually support speeds of up to mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered by g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of megabits a second much faster than g this means users are likely to find g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they aren t those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple antennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as though siemens did not rule out an earlier date
