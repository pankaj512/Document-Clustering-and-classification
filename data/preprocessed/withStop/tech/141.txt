us top of supercomputing charts the us has pushed japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm s prototype blue gene l machine it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory under the us department of energy ibm test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of teraflops the previous top machine japan s nec earth simulator clocked up the top list was announced on monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second once completed in blue gene l will be more powerful than its current prototype next year with the final blue gene four times what it is this year it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat said erich strohmaier one of the co founders of the top list it will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us s nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers in second place was silicon graphics columbia supercomputer based at the us space agency s nasa ames research center in california the linux based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of trillion calculations per second teraflops in october it will be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering the defeated japanese contender the earth simulator which was listed in third place losing the top spot it had held since june it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity since the first supercomputer the cray was installed at los alamos national laboratory us in computational speed has leaped times the cray was capable of megaflops million operations a second the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster started in the top list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh
