wales coach elated with win mike ruddock paid tribute to his wales side after they came from down to beat france in the six nations after going two tries down in minutes we had to show character said the national team coach i didn t have to tell them anything at half time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before they decided they didn t want to do that again and came out fighting it was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back man of the match stephen jones who kicked three penalties a drop goal and conversion was ecstatic following after the win at stade de france it s just a special moment two years ago we didn t win a single game in the six nations but we re a very happy camp now he said we worked hard as a squad and i m a proud welshman we ve got hard matches to come so we re just happy with the start double try scorer martyn williams was keen not to talk about a possible grand slam for wales we ve got more self belief these days two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early there s no mention of a grand slam among the players we ve got a tough game against scotland at murrayfield they could bring us crashing down to earth
