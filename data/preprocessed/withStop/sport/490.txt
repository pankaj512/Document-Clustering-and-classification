safin plays down wimbledon hopes newly crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year safin said he had given up on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind i ll play but with no expectations i feel like i can t waste my time my energy on that surface he said some people they cannot play on clay some people they cannot play on a hard court me i can t play on grass however safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles it s a relief for me two grand slams it s already something but with this one i worked really hard for it he said basically i would love to win a couple more i think i have a chance if i continue this way if coach peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer i think i can make it the year old shocked pete sampras in the us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam i didn t expect that to win the us open it was against sampras i wasn t the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever he said after the first final that i didn t win against thomas johansson in i couldn t see myself winning the grand slams anymore i was once in the semi finals of the french open but i didn t believe i can win it i just couldn t handle the pressure you need to believe in yourself and i didn t and after losing the first set to lleyton hewitt in sunday s final safin said he began to doubt himself again i am i m playing against hewitt at least you have to have the opportunity to win it at least have a chance he said it s like you go there and you lose first set then you start to think this is not my day the way i m playing is ridiculous but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there and i found it i was like really much i was much happier than in that s for sure because i get over it
