The/DT division/NN was/VBD tasked/VBN with/IN improving/VBG US/PRP defences/NNS against/IN malicious/JJ hackers/NNS viruses/NNS and/CC other/JJ net-based/JJ threats./NN
Reports/NNS suggest/VBP he/PRP left/VBD because/IN his/PRP$ division/NN was/VBD not/RB given/VBN enough/JJ clout/NN within/IN the/DT larger/JJR organisation./NN

Mr/NNP Yoran/NNP took/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ post/NN in/IN September/NNP 2003/CD and/CC his/PRP$ first/JJ task/NN was/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT Cyber/NNP Security/NNP Division/NNP up/RB and/CC running./NN

The/DT division/NN was/VBD charged/VBN with/IN thinking/VBG up/RB and/CC carrying/VBG out/RP action/NN to/TO make/VB US/PRP networks/NNS more/RBR impervious/JJ to/TO attack/VB and/CC disruption/NN by/IN the/DT viruses/NNS worms/NNS and/CC hack/VB attacks/NNS that/WDT have/VBP become/VBN commonplace./NN

In/IN the/DT last/JJ 12/CD months/NNS Mr/NNP Yoran/NNP oversaw/VBD the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT cyber/NN alert/NN system/NN that/WDT sends/VBZ out/RP warnings/NNS about/IN big/JJ hitting/NN viruses/NNS and/CC net/JJ attacks/NNS as/IN they/PRP occur./VBP

The/DT Cyber/NNP Security/NNP Division/NNP also/RB audited/VBD US/PRP government/VBP networks/NNS to/TO discover/VB exactly/RB what/WP was/VBD sitting/VBG on/IN which/WDT network./NN
The/DT next/JJ step/NN was/VBD to/TO be/VB the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT scanning/VBG system/NN to/TO identify/VB vulnerabilities/NNS that/WDT made/VBD federal/JJ networks/NNS and/CC machines/NNS susceptible/JJ to/TO attack/VB by/IN malicious/JJ hackers/NNS and/CC virus/NN writers./NN

Some/DT reports/NNS have/VBP suggested/VBN that/IN Mr/NNP Yoran/NNP felt/VBD frustrated/VBN by/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN prominence/NN given/VBN to/TO work/VB to/TO protect/VB against/IN net-based/JJ threats/NNS in/IN the/DT wider/JJR homeland/NN organisation./NN
An/DT attempt/NN by/IN US/PRP politicians/VBZ to/TO pass/VB a/DT law/NN to/TO promote/VB Mr/NNP Yoran/NNP and/CC raise/VB the/DT profile/NN of/IN his/PRP$ department's/NNS work/VBP is/VBZ now/RB mired/VBN in/IN Congress./NNP
